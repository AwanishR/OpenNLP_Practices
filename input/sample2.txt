Public Safety Medical recomends a Prostate exa, in 2 years/
Met with -ABC- to discuss tobacco use and the long term effects of nicotine exposure.  She quit smoking in November 2011 with the help of an e-cigarette.  She was upset that she had to come to the meeting as part of her qualifying health activities. We discussed challenges that she might face and ways to work through them.  I mentioned some of the long term affects associated with long term nicotine exposure.  She feels confident that she will be nicotine free by June.  She is participating in a tough mudder competition and wants to be finished using her e-cigarette at that time.  Because she is highly motivated, she felt that she didn't need further follow ups.  She knows that she can contact the center for resources and help if she needs them.  
Called participant to discuss quitting smoking.  He has been smoking for 35+ years and is not interested at this time in quitting.  He isn't even working on attempting to quit.  He does understand that tobacco and nicotine use has a negative impact on his health, but overall he feels fine.  He works closely with his doctor, so he understands the risks.  His doctor has even stopped asking him about quitting smoking at this point.  I did mention that NRT medication have a $0 copay and gave him the contact number for WellDyne just in case.  He did not welcome a follow up coaching session.  
Met with member to discuss results of biometric data provided by Public Safety Medical.  Results had already been reviewed, so he didn't have any areas of concern.  He is in good health, works out often, and eats a healthy diet.  He goes on group runs with the firefighters on shift days before the day starts--at 5am.  We also discussed the QHA's and what needs to be completed so that he will stay on the gold plan for 2013.  He did not want to have additional coaching at this time.  I provided my contact information so he could get a hold of me if he had issues in the future.  
Met with member to discuss biometric results from PSM.  PSM has reviewed results with him, and he did not have questions or concerns related to numbers. Overall he is healthy, knows what he needs to eat to maintain healthy cholesterol levels.  He is just looking to get back into his exercise routine after having some health issues.  He started back with light walking and some jogging.  He likes to be active at least 4-5 days a week.  No challenges for him now that his body is recovering.  He did not want to participate in follow up coaching at this time.  Reviewed QHAs and what he needed to have completed by 9/28/12 to stay on the gold plan for 2013.  While at the meeting, we got him signed up to myLearning center and he completed his HRA.  He didn't have a computer at home. 
Met with member to discuss biometric results from PSM.  PSM has reviewed results with him already, so he did not have questions/concerns with his results.  He is going through a tough time right now personally--divorce.  So, we talked about utilizing the EAP program.  He has used it in the past and felt that he might reach out to them if things didn't get better soon.  He overall feels that he is a happy person, and now that his wife has moved out of the house things are getting better.  He gets to see his kids often, but is still adjusting to not seeing them as regularly as he used to.  We also talked about getting back on track with his exercise routine as a way to manage stress, along with deep breathing.  He did not want follow up coaching at this time.  We also reviewed the QHA's and what he needs to have completed by 9/28/12 to stay on the gold plan for 2013.

He used to play basketball and baseball in high school, and now just wants to play for fun.  He does have some restrictions--no squats and other lower back strength training exercises.  He is currently back into the exercise routine.  Feels he knows what he needs to do to get back to \ideal\" fitness level.  We talked about listening to his body and knowing his limits to ensure he is safely working out.  We also reviewed QHAs and what he needs to have completed to stay on the gold plan for 2013.

He is excited to meet with Cheryl. He also wants to lose weight, around 40 lbs.  He does get an hour at work for exercise, but he is swamped and feels that he cannot really get away.  He is working long hours as it is.  We talked about prioritizing his goals, since there are a lot of things he is working on.  He thinks right now exercise is the first thing to work on.  He does have plantar fasciitis, and arthritis in his hip, so prefers to either walk or ride a bike.  His bike folds up, so encouraged him to keep in his car to ride around the fire house on his exercise time.  Also encouraged him to split up his ex time, versus going an entire hour straight so it wouldn't seem so overwhelming.  He is working on reducing portions at meals, and even shares meals with his wife when they dine out.  His goal for exercise is 2-3x/wk for 30 minutes for at least the first month.  Second goal is to meet with RD for diabetes education.  Gave him handouts on diabetes and nutrition.  Talked about journaling his calories and encouraged him to join myfitnesspal.  We discussed QHAs and what need to be completed by 9/28/12 to stay on the gold plan.

Met with member to review results of biometric screening.  PSM has already reviewed results with him.  He is working on weight loss and is exercising a couple days a week.  He was following a modified version of the adkins diet, which he lost 40 lbs on.  No longer losing weight, but wants to lose another 40-50 lbs.  Discussed making changes to his current exercise routine since he has been doing the same thing for a year now.  Suggested that he do some interval training and provided him examples of how to apply this to his stationary biking routine.  He has not been following his low carb diet lately.  We talked about getting back on track nutritionally.  His doctor was okay with the modified Adkins diet, so told him to continue with that.  explained that the Adkins diet can sometimes cause lipids to be elevated.  He will set up another coaching appointment with us once the center opens.  He likes the idea of meeting with someone.  We did review QHAs and what he needs to have completed by 9/28/12 to stay on the gold plan.

Met with member to discuss results of biometric screening.  PSM had already reviewed and she did not want to discuss further.  She is working on losing weight.  Her motivation is to fit into her clothes.  She doesn't want to have to buy a new wardrobe.  She does have a gym membership and plays in a volleyball league.  She isn't that motivated to do traditional exercise, so group sports tend to work best.  Is also into golf.  Talked about modifying her diet and tracking her calories.  She does have apps on her phone that she likes to use, and has started back tracking.  She feels she knows what she needs to do.  Discussed using reward systems to improve motivation.

She is doing both cardio and ST at LA Fitness.  She is a lifetime member of WeightWatchers, but does not want to have to count points.  We discussed eating healthy foods, yet eating smaller portions.  We talked about eating frozen yogurt versus ice cream when she and her husband are out and about.  Gave some locations of places around the city.  She is also going to grow her own garden, so this summer it will be very easy for her to eat a lot of veggies.  She does not want to have to use artificial sweeteners, so discussed trying stevia--either liquid or powder form.  She feels like these meetings are helpful and will take the place of the weight watcher meetings that she has been missing.  We will follow up in a month.  She feels that she doesn't really have challenges as her husband is also starting to eat healthier and have an interest in exercise.

He is using the lozenges and things are going well.  He is staying busy with work and also chewing lots of gum.  He understands that he is still having nicotine exposure with the gum, but knows that this is better for him than actually smoking.  He is working on gradually reducing nicotine until he is off of that too.  He has wanted to quit for a long time and feels proud of his accomplishment.  His wife is a big support for him.

Met with member to discuss nicotine exposure.  He was chewing and occasionally smoking.  He called his doctor and got on chantix.  He has not had to use tobacco products in 7 days now.  His doctor gave him a month supply of chantix and if he needs more, his doctor said to call and he would call in a refill.  This is something that he wanted to do after his dad passed last month of cancer.  He is motivated right now, and has not had to deal with any cravings, however, he is chewing a lot of gum.  We talked a bit about ways to manage stress as this can sometimes be a challenge for him. He was open to suggestions. Right now he feels strong and that he will be successful.  He does have a good support system.  I encouraged him to work with me if he runs into barriers/challenges in the future.  No follow ups at this time.

We explored this use a little further, and he feels that since he is working on managing his blood sugar, eating healthier, and losing weight, that he hasn't been around tobacco.  He doesn't feel that he is using it other than for social reasons and it is easy for him to stay away from.

His doctors felt that it kept going off due to the nicotine use, so that was his main motivator for quitting.  He is still having issues and to date has had to have 6-7 ablations.  This is starting to stress him out, and making him want to have more tobacco, but is motivated enough to avoid.  He thinks that he is ready to go down to one pouch a day in the next week.  He is also balling up gum and keeping in his mouth to help avoid pouch use.  We discussed health benefits of quitting even though it has not yet made a difference with heart issues.  He still feels he is doing the right thing.  He is still working with his doctors to correct the issues.  He feels that the next step heart wise is to get a transplant.  His daughter just moved back from college for the summer, so that is extra motivation to quit.  He welcomed a follow up next month.

Met with member to discuss tobacco use.  She has been smoke free in the past, longest time has been 7 months.  She is currently smoking around a pack a day.  She is getting motivated again to quit.  She does enjoy smoking and knows that it is disgusting.  She is motivated to quit for her grandson, who now lives with him because she knows she is putting him at risk from having it show up in his lab work.  When she quit in the past she used the patch.  She will use this in the future.  She isn't quite ready to quit, said she was around a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10.  10 is ready to quit tomorrow, and 1 not at all ready to quit.  We talked about cutting back and using the delay method to start with before she seriously thinks about using the patches again.  She wants to follow up with me once she has more time to work through her grief.  Her son has passed away, sounded like an accident and she is seeing a therapist.  She knows that she needs to deal with that before focusing on quitting.

She has a 3 month old granddaughter, so that is a good motivator.  she has already stopped smoking in the house since granddaughter lives with her, which she believes is helping her to cut back.

Met with member to discuss tobacco use.  He is chewing around 2 pouches of skol a day.  He has a lot of back issues and is on a lot o pain medication.  He walks to help with pain and because the pain meds give him cotton mouth, he uses the chew to avoid that.  Once he is finished walking he takes it out.  In the past he was chewing up to 3-4 cans a week, now a can lasts him 2-3 weeks.  At this time, he is not willing to give up the chewing tobacco.

Prediabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity
Howard has made great progress this month.  He has been eating smaller portions, avoiding all fried foods, eating less red meat, increased water, less Sprite (only 1-2/day), and kept the goal to try one new food a week.  One of those new foods was switching to oil & vinegar on his salad instead of creamy ranch.  And he has not eaten Reese's Peanut Butter cups in one month.  He is using myfitnesspal to log his foods.   No exercise as he is working two 40 hour jobs.  Wt. = 213.8 lbs (decrease 8.4#), body fat 30.8% (decrease 1%).  Waist = 45\ (was 45.5\")  Labs: all improved, except for FBS was 114 (previous year 104), so still is prediabetes even though his PCP scratched that off of his wellness CPE.  Howard is motivated to continue to improve his health, and praise given for achievements made so far.  He asked about using 5 hour energy shots, and I dissuaded him from using that in place of needed sleep.    Howard agrees to keep current behavior changes, plus:  1) Get a bathroom scale to monitor his weight. 2) Get a tape measure to measure waist once a week.  3) Purchase a set of 10lb free weights, and do a 10 minute routine every other day.   4)  Goal of 5 servings of fresh veggies & fruit/day.  5)  Add something fresh, and some protein to breakfast.  6) Add nuts either to breakfast, or as a mid-morning or middle of night (when working) snack.

Has notice about 10pts in his GLU since he started his day to day routine with exercise and nutrition.  
"Emailed me for help because she is wanting to lose weight.  She is starting her routine tomorrow.  I gave her information on what she should do starting off. Asked her for more specifics for I can assist her more and create S.M.A.R.T goals for her.    

When it comes to nutrition I told her to start off making sure you are getting at least 3 meals in a day ESPECIALLY BREAKFAST.  In all three of those meals trying to incorporate a fruit or vegetable.  If you are eating any type of breads or pastas make sure they are Whole Grain.  Try sticking to mostly chicken, turkey, and fish.  Red meat twice a week is plenty.  Invest in Almonds or nuts as snacks.  Eggs are a cheap and great source of protein.  Portion control is key.  Take your time when you eat.  It takes 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain you are full.  Try to eliminate or cut down on the amount of soda you are drinking.  If you are drinking regular soda try and switch to diet soda. 

DRINK A LOT OF WATER!!!!

"Amy has started testing her blood sugars, FBS as low as 60, and after meals as high as 180.  Did not attend OA, because she was busy moving. Also has not yet begun journaling.  Did start wearing tennis shoes ~ 80% of time when walking the dog.  Has begun eating breakfast, low sugar oatmeal. Has changed drive through meals to Kashi frozen dinners, bought bagged greens for salad (which she has eaten 3 out of the last 4 days), and found her free weights (but hasn?t started using them yet). It seems that Amy was taking her glimepiride 2 mg 3-4 times a day (it is a once daily medication) along with taking anywhere from 60-100 units of NPH at bedtime. This is a highly unusual and dangerous way to manage diabetes.  I counseled Amy on how to properly use these medications. Since she has only been on insulin for 8 months, she states she would really like to come off of it.  Again, I counseled her on how that could be possible.  At 5?5?, Wt. = 234.4lbs.  body fat = 41.2%.  Amy agrees to: 1) Obtain her dilated eye exam. 2) Take glimepiride only once daily in the AM. 3) Continue to test her blood sugar, keeping a log book of sugar reading, insulin dose, what her food intake is, and how she felt.  On days she is not at work, test more often as she is decreasing insulin.  4) Continue to improve on  fresh veggies, lean protein, & controlled carb portions. 5) Start resistance type exercise with free weights.  Will also use her stationary bicycle, and x-box Wii when she unpacks them.

I'm sorry that I have been hard to get ahold of as of late. For the last couple weeks I've been working from 8 am to 6 pm. Though I'm not able to reach you between the hours of 8:30 and 4:30, it is my hope that we are able to reach an agreement on a time to go over my test results. 

P.S. My usual work schedule is 10:00-6:00 but am currently seeing a lot of overtime. I do not know when this will change. Thank you for your time.
"
"Good morning!  Thank you for your reply! I completely understand, there aren't enough hours in the day it seems!  I will be out screening with another client from noon today until late tomorrow afternoon. Or I can email your results, which I certainly do not mind doing.  Because your results are confidential, I would need to send them encrypted- you would have to set up a password to open the email.  Is this something you would be interested in?  Or I can stay late Wednesday or Thursday evening to talk with you.  Just let me know which works best for you.  
I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.

Met over the phone to do TOB #1.  He has been chewing for about 15 years.  1 can will last him about a day and a half.  He said he just enjoys doing it.  Now that he has daughters he wants to quit.  His wife quit smoking on Wellbutrin.  He has never used an NRT before.  Biggest triggers are after runs, fishing, and sporting events.  Very routine for him,  Oral fixation.  Mentally dependent more than physically.  Goal:  research NRTs and decide by next week which one he is going to try.  Wants to quit by Dec. 1 his daughters bday.  
TOB #1
member number on kyn sheet is disconnected, however, after searching and finding the goal worksheet, i found a working number, left voicemail. have sent email as well. dphillips rn 
"I recently completed the know your numbers health screening. I have tried to call you but with the holiday and all I guess I missed you.  Now I was at my friends house and just for fun , as we were talking about the screenings, he checked my blood sugar and it was rediculous,(378). I am now terrified that my health is seriously declining. I have worked so hard to avoid my fathers lifestyle but got blind sided by the sugar, not in my family. Please tell me what else is going on. I am now in a panic to get educated and get this under control. I can only imagine what the other numbers are seeing as heart disease does in fact run in the family.  I hope we have caught this early enough to avoid any serious damage. 
 
thanks

Went over results & QHA's. 
Met to do DOB #1.  He claims he is not a diabetic.  Not on meds for GLU.  Encourage him to see his doctor ASAP.  Has started to watch his portions.  Still eating unhealthy at fast food every morning for breakfast.  Walks everyday for 45mins -1hr.  Has lost 8lbs since March.

Met over the phone to do TOB #5.  He said he is still not ready to quit.  He is smoking a little under a pack and a half a day.  Hoping to get his physical scheduled in the next week. 
TOB #5
"Hello!  Your results are as follows:
Lab test			Value			Normal/Abnormal		Desired level:
Blood Sugar		89			N				less than 100
Hemoglobin A1c	5.3			N				less than 5.7
Blood Pressure		124/77							120/80 and lower
Total Cholesterol	171			N				less than 200
HDL (the good cholesterol)  50			N				above 40
LDL (the bad cholesterol) 109							less than 100
Triglycerides		62			N				less than 150
Body Mass Index	21.1			N				less  than 25

Your systolic blood pressure of 124 is just above the desired level of 120.  This can change from minute to minute.  Your LDL- the ?bad? cholesterol is just above the desired level of less than 100.  There are some things you can do to reduce the LDL.  With regard to diet:
*increasing the amount of whole grains and fiber in your diet can help reduce the LDL.  If you haven?t already, change from white bread/white rice/white pasta  to whole grain products.  Labels can be misleading- bread should say specifically that it is WHOLE GRAIN- NOT just MULTI grain.  Brown rice and whole grain pastas are widely available these days and provide more fiber in the diet than the regular bleached products that just break down to starch and sugar.  
*eat more fish high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake  trout, herring , sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega -3 fatty acids.
Exercise is important in the management of  cholesterol.  Being more active- taking brisk 30 minute walks  several times a week is a good place to begin.  Do you have a regular exercise routine in place?  
CONGRATULATIONS!  Overall, your values are very good.  I would encourage you to continue utilizing good health habits.

3/20/13   1645 Member returned call.  States she is doing well, except her thyroid levels  get out of balance sometimes.  She still has a thyroid gland, but ?it just doesn?t work?.  Taking synthroid 100 mcg daily.  States she knows when her levels are out of balance, because she starts feeling really poorly, has bone pain and muscle aches.  Does not see an endocrinologist.  Not sure what her t3,t4 , or TSH run.  Encouraged to ask her physician to check these labs, she may be lacking in T3, which can cause bone and muscle pain.   Asked if she is taking generic Synthroid- she is, states it?s the only way she can afford it.  Explained that generic forms can vary in their potency, and if she has to use generic, to ask pharmacy to try and fill her medication from the same manufacturer, this may help ensure a better response.  
Member has had several family members ill and deaths in her family recently.  Encouraged her to take care of herself as much as possible.    KWellsRN

2/19/2013  1530  Member returned my call.  States his biggest health issue is asthma.  He uses his nebulizer twice a day, in the morning and at night.  He uses an albuterol inhaler, symbicort, and abreva.  States as long as he sticks with his medicine regimen he does well.  He has had a cold for the past few weeks and this aggravates the asthma.  Encouraged him to continue taking care of his asthma, using his medications  as  directed.  States he recently lost his wife of many years, has a son and a daughter, both in their 30s.  He enjoys fishing, he travels to many places to fish.  He is having cataract surgery next week on his right eye.  He talked for about 23 minutes?states he almost hates coming home because he misses his wife so much.  He does have a dog, a german shepherd, that keeps him company.  He works in the nursing home, he feels needed and appreciated there by the residents.   KWellsRN

4/17/2013  Member called, states is doing well right now but had an exacerbation a couple weeks ago and had to go to the ER with his asthma.  He has noticed that all the while he is at work, he is coughing.  It doesn?t start until he gets to work- it doesn?t happen when at home.  He thinks it may possibly be from perfumes/cleaners/disinfectant at work, not sure what it is but he doesn?t cough like that at home.  He reports having difficulty staying asleep the entire night.  He wakes up about 3am and has to use his nebulizer so he can clear his lungs and rest better.  He does not have a peak flow meter- encouraged him to talk with his md about getting one.   He has noticed that he can sleep fine in the recliner all night but when lying flat he doesn?t rest as well.  Suggested that he use several pillows or a wedge to elevate his upper body when sleeping, maybe this will help.  He is going to ask his md about a sleep study also.  He hasn?t had allergy testing done in thirty years.  Mentioned that this may be something worth looking into, he will talk with his md about it.  
His cataract surgery went well last month and he is pleased with the improvement in his vision.  He is looking forward to a big fishing trip with friends next week.  Will check back with him in  six weeks to see how he is doing.

Please feel free to contact me via email.
My reply:  
My apologies for taking so long to reply, I was out of state screening  in Pennsylvania the end of last week.  
Just wanted to review your Know Your Number Results and see if you have any questions about them.  Privacy laws require that your personal health information be protected, so in order to discuss them via email you will need a password to access that information via an encrypted email.  I will send you an email following this one that just says ?password setup?- it will guide you through creating a password.  Once you have set up that password, please let me know, then I can send your results.  
Hope you are having a great day!
---KWells,RN
6/5/2013  Received email from member indicating that she has set up her password. Sent the following encrypted email:
Hello Alicia,
Your results are as follows:
Fasting Blood Sugar- 			77		normal
Hemoglobin A1c			5.2		normal
Blood pressure				114/68		normal
Total cholesterol			234		elevated- desired level is below 200
HDL (the ?good? cholesterol)		80		normal-  very good level
LDL (the ?bad? cholesterol)		137		elevated- desired level is below 100
Triglycerides				84		normal  desired level is below 150
Overall your results are very good!  Congratulations on an excellent blood pressure!  You are doing something right ?
The two areas that could use some tweaking are your total cholesterol, and your LDL.  There are some things you can do to help reduce these.
With regard to your diet- Adding fiber is a good way to help control cholesterol.  Fiber is not absorbed by the body- it actually absorbs cholesterol and fat and takes it away.  Try adding whole grains to your diet., This is a good way to increase  fiber, by changing from white bread/rice/pasta to whole grain products.  Thankfully, there is an ever increasing variety of whole grain products available these days.  
Reducing saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol in your diet can improve triglyceride levels as well as help manage cholesterol. Limit your intake of red meat to help reduce saturated fat intake.
Eat more fish high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega-3 fatty acids.  
Regular exercise is very helpful in helping reduce cholesterol  --even just ten minutes, three times a day is beneficial.

A few questions for you-
Do you have a regular exercise routine?  What does it include?
Does elevated cholesterol run in your family?
Have you seen your physician to review your results?  What changes, if any,  did he/she recommend?

I?m looking forward to hearing your response.  I am attaching some information you may find helpful. 
---KWells,RN
6/6/2013  Received email from member:
Good evening.  Thank you for sending the results.  I have not discussed these with my doctor, as I am trying to lower the LDL and total cholesterol on my own first, as I do not want to be put on a drug for the rest of my life.I currently exercise 7 days a week - from 1 hour or more.  I am an athlete; swimming, biking, running, weight training, stretching, circuit training and yoga.  I participate in triathlons, marathons, mountain biking, road biking, open water swimming, masters swimming (pool), etc...
I currently take the following vitamins/supplements:  multi vitamin, calcium, CoQ10, Red Yeast Rice, garlic, fish oil, C, and fiber.
I do not eat white bread, rice or pasta - I eat brown rice, whole grain breads and pastas.  I avoid sugar; I do not drink soda, iced tea, coffee, alcohol, or most fruit juices.  I drink orange juice, diluted (1/4 juice to 3/4 water).  I strive to eat un-processed foods.  I do not eat fish - I eat a lot of chicken, making an effort to eat less red meat; eat more vegetables.  I've incorporated a meatless day each week.  I've replaced dairy milk with soy milk.  I do not eat fast food.
My response via email:
WOW!!  You are awesome!!  You are doing all the right things, and then some!!  I am wondering if there is a family history of elevated cholesterol issues- if you are doing all these right things, but the cholesterol doesn?t come down, there may be a genetic component to your cholesterol elevation.  If that is the case, it is very difficult to reduce cholesterol without medication. I completely understand not wanting to be on a cholesterol medication- and you are definitely doing everything right to keep from going that route. 
Certainly it will be good to have your physician re-check your labs to evaluate your progress. Please let me know if I may be of assistance.  
Have a great day!

We discussed ways to decrease sugar/carbohydrate intake- looked at his breakfast oatmeal- the instant packet he has been using contains 13 grams of sugars and 27 grams of carbohydrates.  Homemade oatmeal has  less than one gram of sugar.  He will change to making his own oatmeal to help decrease his sugar/ carb intake.  Also encouraged him to have  lean protein at each meal.   Starting with a couple days a week to begin with, he could change breakfast to two boiled eggs and whole grain toast, or egg beaters and whole grain toast and a small serving of fruit.    
He doesn?t exercise very often besides what he does at work- although he is very active doing yardwork during the warm months.  Encouraged him to add in walking on a daily basis whenever possible, enough to raise his heart rate.  Stressed that exercise is a very important part of staying healthy.  
He was concerned about a sheet that he brought home with him from his recent md appt, it listed as a diagnosis for him chronic kidney disease, stage 3 moderate?- but he didn?t know anything about it?stated he wasn?t told anything about that at the md office.  Encouraged him to call the md back for clarification .

5/24/2013  Member called, he has lost 45 pounds in the past year using the Eat To Live book as a guideline.  He eats lots of fruits and vegetables, not as much meat (no red meat), whole grains, some nuts.  He had seen his MD last year and was going to be put on medicine for both cholesterol AND high blood pressure, and he did not want to be put on medications, so he lost weight and has been able to stay off the meds.  He doesn?t have a regular exercise program , lack of time is the problem.  He works all day at work, then at home there is always something to get done in the evenings.  Discussed ways to creatively add in some activity-  parking farther out in the parking lot at the store, taking the stairs in stead of the elevator, doing a few situps or jumping jacks during commercials if watching TV.  Congratulated him on his progress, he would like to lose another ten pounds that he had gained back- encouraged him to keep up the great work.  ---KWellsRN

"4/2/2013  Called member to review KYN results- member is asleep , a female that identified herself as his wife states she can take the information.  Explained to her that without the members authorization I cannot disclose any personal health information to her.  She insisted that she has authorization to talk with all his other providers.   I explained that I realize she has authorization at his other providers but we do not have that information on file here at DDHC.  She stated she would get Mr. Jones up and have him give me the authorization- advised her that he could just call back, not to interrupt him while he is sleeping.  She stated he will not be up until 8pm tonight, and will get off about 6:30am.  I heard her yelling to someone, she stated ?this is the people that was at your work- can you give them authorization to talk to me?- I heard a male voice in the background  state ?yes?.  Did not have opportunity to verify that the male person was the  member or ask his birthdate.  The female then got back on the phone and I tried to explain that I had not had opportunity to verify the members identity by having him say his name and date of birth- asked if she could  take my number and have him call me.  She was very short and stated that she would not ask him anything, nor would she write down our number to have him call back, that we would just have to call back when we think we can reach him.  Then she hung up the phone.  
Faxed lab results to members md.  Will call member in am.

5/22/2013 Talked with member on phone.  He sees his physician every three months.  He was diagnosed three years ago with diabetes.  His father had high blood pressure, and didn?t take care of it- he died with renal failure.  Member is very motivated to do all he can to take care of himself.  He eats heart healthy, and exercises on his elliptical usually daily.  He isn?t as consistent with it in the summertime because he is busy outside.  He takes simvastatin, flaxseed, and fish oil.  His triglycerides were 289 three years ago- he is proud and relieved that they are lower now.

5/16/2013  Member called.  He saw his md last week.  States his md talked with him about cutting the sugar from his diet, losing weight, to help reduce the a1c and blood pressure.  Discussed ways to cut carbohydrates- he has been drinking regular orange juice- but is going to change to the Tropicana 50- half the sugar of regular OJ.  He doesn?t eat a lot of cakes/cookies, etc., but he does eat ice cream.  Encouraged him to try the lower sugar or sugar free kinds.  We discussed how helpful  exercise is in reducing a1c/bp.  He is going to work toward increasing his exercise also, with the goal of losing 25 pounds in the coming year.  He has already talked with his wife, who is supportive of his efforts, and she is on board to help with preparing healthier dishes.  Will follow up with member in six weeks to cheer him on, check his progress.   Emailed member the following information:

States she was a bit anxious about the screening blood draw, that?s probably why her bp was elevated at that time.  Encouraged her to take bps at home and keep a record of it, and take this information with her to the dr. appt. There is a family history of diabetes.  We discussed the ADA guidelines that place her in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  Discussed ways to reduce the a1c- reducing sugar/carbohydrate intake, increase exercise, increase fiber in her diet, add lean protein to each meal.  She doesn?t drink sodas, if she does it is diet soda.  Usually drinks water or flavored water, sweetened with artificial sweetener.

1105  Member return my call.  He doesn?t have a physician at this time but will be selecting one.  He has not had his bp rechecked since the screening, states he had been doing some pretty heavy lifting the morning of the screening, at work.  Historically he remembers his bp being more like 120/80.  He follows a heart healthy diet, eats mostly whole grains and tries diligently to eat healthy.  He rarely eats out, rarely eats red meat, he doesn?t drink sodas.  In the past he worked in the fitness industry, and has a good understanding of the importance of regular exercise in maintaining good health.  He said after work though he is so worn out he cannot imagine trying to do any more than what he has already done.  He does park farther out in the parking lot when he goes to the store, so he has to walk more.  His work requires a lot of heavy lifting.  He doesn?t have a weight problem.  There is a questionable family history of elevated cholesterol.  He will check with his father and share this information with his physician.  
We discussed increasing intake  of fish, to get the benefit of omega-3 fatty acids.  He will be locating an md soon and going for f/u.      KWells,RN

5/14/2013  Talked with member about KYN results.   He has been on bp med for approx. 2 years.  He doesn?t check his bp at home.  Encouraged him to check it daily and keep a record of the readings, then take this information with him to his checkup with md. 
He eats fast food nearly every day of the week from McDonalds.  Discussed the high fat and salt content of these foods and how it affects your blood pressure, and triglycerides.    Encouraged him to take a little time to plan ahead- bring a sandwich from home, with whole grain bread, lean meat, lettuce, tomato, and vegetables to snack on instead of burgers and fries.  He isn?t drinking sodas ?usually drinks water.  He is willing to start making changes to his diet.  Discussed how this will help to reduce his triglycerides, and hopefully his bp, as well has help him lose weight.  Encouraged him to exercise as well.  He had been working out at the Y, but had gotten away from it. He is going to start going again.  I will call to follow up with him in a month to see how his progress is coming.  He is excited and motivated to improve his health.

Her husband was diabetic she states she is knowledgeable about diet and how to watch carbohydrate and sugar intake.
She recently had her mammogram.   She  has gotten away from exercising .  She will be getting back to walking regularly, to help reduce her a1c.  She will see her md to have bp rechecked. Encouraged her to take one day at a time and call me if I can be of assistance.  Emailed member the following Pre-diabetes information:  GET REAL!

Stated she fears the cancer will come back, as it was non-hodgkins.   She had neck surgery in June 2012.  She smokes but is trying to cut back, with the help of a patch.  She was able to use it eight days in a row recently, and didn?t smoke for eight days, but then relapsed and began to smoke again.  Congratulated her on the eight days off cigarettes, and encouraged her to resume with her efforts to stop.  Member states she has lost 50 pounds and follows a healthy diet.  Congratulated her on this and encouraged her to continue to make healthy diet choices.  She stated her most difficult health issue at this time is the pain in her legs ?she feels her leg muscles are drawing and she needs some instruction on stretches to help ease them.  She is not currently attending physical therapy for this. Member stated that sometimes she falls into a depressive state and doesn?t return phone calls in a timely fashion.  She prefers mail communication to emails, stated she doesn?t always check emails on a regular basis.  
She doesn?t remember why her FBS in June 2012 was 127- reports she was three days postop at that time and thinks she wasn?t actually fasting.  No family history of diabetes, no symptoms.  
She would like a call back on Friday of this week , wants very much to stay in touch with care manager.  Will call her back Friday 2/8/2013.   KWellsRN
2/8/2013  0845  Called member, she is an hour behind EST- will call me back when she gets son to school.  She called back and we talked. She did talk to a physical therapist yesterday about the concerns she has about her leg muscles, PT gave her some instructions/exercises to do to help stretch the muscles involved.  She said she lives in terrible pain every day- as soon as her legs hit the floor in the morning, she feels that shooting, stabbing pain; she stated her work makes it worse because she is on her feet for 12 hour shifts (worked 14 hours yesterday).  She doesn?t feel a change in jobs is possible because she is established at her current job and her health conditions do not make her a good candidate- other employers wouldn?t want to hire her.  She does report that she has a good support system, her fianc�  and three children (8, 15, 20yrs) are helpful and make her life easier.  She said she has talked with her doctor about the leg pain and he suggested lyrica, which she is already taking, but cannot take it when she has to work.    Talked with her about stopping smoking- she said she has done it before, for a year even, but ends up smoking again, her stress level has been so high for so long she doesn?t have the energy to quit most of the time.  She gets started but relapsed.  She did say that she was thinking yesterday ?wondering how quickly her lungs would heal, and what changes would take place if she quit.  She has not yet received the packet I sent on Feb. 6 that details just that information.  Reviewed with her the changes that occur within 20 minutes after quitting up to the changes that are still taking place years after quitting.  We talked about her ?why??what are the reasons for quitting.  Encouraged her to not give up on quitting.  She will call me next week when she has received and reviewed her packet in the mail.

States she has been running a low grade temp off and on for about a year and a half, and recently has noticed that when it happens, she becomes very fatigued.  She is also experiencing pain in her left inguinal area, which is the same place her pain was prior to the diagnosis of non-hodgkins lymphoma.  She did see her OB/GYN last month for a yearly pap, and she saw her pain management md- he recommended that she make an appt with her oncologist, Dr. Greco.  She is comfortable with him and trusts his judgment.   She is still working, but states her schedule this month will be better, she won?t be working Mondays or Fridays.   
She states her boyfriend is very supportive and understands when she needs to just rest.  Encouraged her to rest as much as possible, keep up her fluid intake to prevent dehydration with the elevated temperatures.

FBS in Jan 2013 was 90.  She had been on Lipitor after the June labs but was unable to tolerate the painful side effects.  Has been taking Krill oil since stopping the Lipitor.  She follows a heart healthy diet, uses rice milk, eats very little red meat.  States her weight has been the same ,145-150, for years. States she feels good, but is concerned about her labs.

4/1/2013  Received message from member, she had called in on 3/26 stated her physician told her to watch her diet and exercise, that her A1c was elevated.   Called member back, left her a message to please return my call.  KWellsRN

4/3/2013  Member called, states she did see md in March, was told she was at a moderate risk to develop diabetes, that she should watch her diet and she should exercise more.  States the md office told her that her a1c was elevated but she does not know what the number was- stated md did not repeat any labs at the March visit.   She does not recall having any symptoms of diabetes- no excessive thirst or urination, undue fatigue or weight loss.  Her mother was a diet controlled diabetic.
Her doctor prescribed  Tricor to help with her triglyceride level, but she has not started taking it yet.  Has concerns about possible side effects, as she was unable to tolerate simvastatin- it caused her to ache badly in her joints. Discussed the mechanism that causes the muscle ache/joint pain.  Encouraged her to try the medication, and if she has undesirable side effects she can talk with md about what to do (possibly decrease or stagger doses- but not to do any of these without checking first with MD).  It would be best to at least try the medication, and hopefully she can tolerate it and it will be effective in lowering her triglycerides, which was over 600 at last check.  
Discussed with her the things she can do also to help decrease her A1c as well as her triglycerides:  In particular: Cut down or cut out pre-prepared foods, eating out, pre-processed food.  Drink water instead of soda, or at least drink diet soda.  Increase fruits and vegetables in her diet, and fiber- use whole grain bread (she is already doing this).  Make sure she is getting lean protein at every meal.  Eat more baked/broiled fish/chicken.  She should exercise daily-  she has a pretty large yard and feels she can walk two laps every day for exercise.

3/20/2013  Member returned my call.  States he has been diabetic for 9 years, and he was never a person to go to the dr unless something was terribly wrong.  He has neuropathy in his legs.  He takes several different medications for the diabetes, including Lantus at night.  He checks his bs twice daily- it ranges between 110-240.  Has appt to have his labs checked with md next week.  States he knows she is going to ?yell? at him because of his labs.  His labs  were high right after the holidays- he doesn?t get much exercise in the colder winter months, but when it warms up he exercises more and his diabetes is better managed. He does walk his dogs at night and he walks a lot at work.   His dr does monitor his kidney function, and has encouraged him to see an ophthalmologist for a diabetic eye exam, and also a colonoscopy.  He does not remember what his A1c was at last check.  He eats many things that he knows he shouldn?t, per his report, but doesn?t feel the need to change.  Discussed the long term effects of elevated bs/A1c- possible blindness, kidney damage, etc.  Reminded him that his body has already suffered neuropathy, that is not reversible, we want to prevent further damage.  Neither are eye and kidney damage reversible.  Reminded that even though he doesn?t feel that damage is occurring, it is.  Encouraged him to see eye dr for dilated eye exam, explained reason for this.  Discussed his diet- he is eating cheerios and a banana for breakfast, with 2%milk, and sometimes adds a muffin to that.  Encouraged to add some protein in, and perhaps only � banana, and not eat the muffin.  Encouraged to try changing small things at the time- adding protein with each meal and cutting back on carbohydrates.    He does like boiled eggs, will start eating a boiled egg with breakfast.  He prepares most of the meals at home.  He usually takes a sandwich for lunch and chips.  He knows he needs to not have the chips- encouraged to change this to a small piece of fruit.  Discussed changing from white bread to whole grain, from white to brown rice.  States he eats sugar free cookies?sometimes several of them with 2-3 glasses of milk, he has cut back some on the milk-  he didn?t realize that the sugar free cookies  still have lots of carbohydrates and this affects the blood sugar.     KWellsRN
He had lost weight, from 204 down to 187, but is back up to 197 at this time.  Congratulated him on losing the weight, encouraged him to work toward taking it back off.  As the weather warms up he will be more active, and states the weight will come off.    KWellsRN
Will check back with him in about three weeks to see how his md visit went.  Encouraged him to visit the DDHC website.

4/30/2013 Member called, she states her cholesterol is now within normal limits.  She is having some fatigue, and unexplained weight gain, despite being active and dieting.  She dances- ballroom, latin, and country/western.  She enjoys hiking.    She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.  She has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, but feels her pain may be from something other than fibromyalgia, possibly her thyroid levels being off.    She is going to see her physician and ask for  a complete thyroid panel, not just the TSH that the md has been running.  Encouraged her to keep a log of her lab results, and how she feels each time her labs are drawn;  this information can be helpful to the physician in planning for treatment.  She reports having had a thyroid storm  last year, that did not require hospitalization.  She will follow up with me after she gets all her thyroid labs  done. ?KWells,RN

"Member called DDHC to ask that she continue to be considered ?active? in the health/wellness coaching program.  She had breast CA, completed her treatment in June 2012.  This was her second bout with breast cancer. She is happy that her PET scan was negative.  
 Stated she is doing fairly well in her recovery, but she has developed diabetes, secondary to the cancer treatment medications.  She sees her pcp regularly, and is on diabetes medication, which she takes regularly. Her fbs at home runs 93-98.  She goes to the gym usually 4 times per week and is working with a personal trainer to help her lose weight. She does weight and resistance training, and zumba.  She has cut out her nighttime snacking.  
She reports that she doesn?t have a very strong support system, but states she is doing ok.  Offered that she is welcome to call me if she ever needs to talk.  She is content with her health plan at this time, and is comfortable with her caregivers, feels she has a good relationship with them.   
Notified A. Tedor of members wish  to be active in the health/wellness program so that she does not incur a penalty.  KWellsRN

"3/1/2013  Member called to inquire as to how he can participate in the wellness/health coaching program so he no longer has to pay the $45 penalty.  Will check and get an answer for him as soon as possible.  KWellsRN

3/4/2013   Ms. Tedor will have members status changed to participating so that his penalty for nonparticipation is removed.  Called member to inform him of this.  He is getting married this year in August, would like to lose 20-25 pounds by then.  He was in the marines previously and said he is well versed in how to lose the weight- he will begin working out again.  He cannot remember what his exact lab values or bp were the last time he screened, but thinks the top number of his bp was elevated a bit, and his cholesterol as well.  He felt he is in good health but does want to lose weight and work toward improving his bp and cholesterol.  We discussed the benefits of exercise and diet with regard to how these things affect bp and cholesterol.  Discussed changing from white bread/ white flour products  to whole grains,  increasing lean  protein in the diet and decreasing simple carbohydrates. Increasing fiber and vegetables/fruits will help with cholesterol also.   He would like to receive diet information via email.  We agreed that I will follow up with him in one month to check on his progress.  Congratulated him on his upcoming wedding, and encouraged him to work toward his weight loss goal so we can cheer when he reaches it!
Sent member email with diet information: Hello!  It was nice talking with you.   I am excited to be working with you and look forward to seeing you reach your goal!  I have attached some helpful information for your review. 
  I will be following up with you as planned in a month, but in the meantime if you need assistance please don?t hesitate to contact me at the number below, or via email.  Have a great week!

5/14/2013  Member returned my call.   He wasn?t interested in talking about his KYN ?told me he didn?t know why it was necessary to discuss it, because he sees his doctor regularly anyway.  He has not had his bp rechecked since the screening, but states his md knows it runs ?about that? ( 140/90)and he is ok with it.  Discussed the ADA guidelines that place his a1c of 5.8 in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  Discussed measures to help decrease the a1c ?cutting out white rice/ white bread/ potatoes, increasing activity/exercise.  He states he doesn?t drink regular sodas or sweet tea.  Also encouraged him to add more fruits/vegetables to his diet.   Talked about his cholesterol, he was adamant that his physician is happy with his cholesterol at 248, since his HDL is 130- stated that he would have to argue with me about his cholesterol if I wanted to talk to him about the tchol being 248.

5/8/2013  1147  Member called, she was very distraught, tearful.  She just wants to do whatever she has to do to keep from having money taken out of her check (being compliant with health/wellness program).  She still suffers from the cyclic vomiting syndrome, and depression, and about ten days ago learned that she has a left parietal lobe meningioma, it is causing her to have double vision in her left eye.     She was very distraught.  She lives alone.  She said she was very depressed about it, and at this point did not know what her treatment plan would include.  She was unsure when her follow up appointment was.  She said she had been calling her dr. to ask these things but has not received an answer yet.  She feels that no one cares, that medical care is all about money and she said if ?they don?t care then I don?t either?.  She said she has taken care of other people all her life and she doesn?t ask for help from others.  I asked if she has a friend or roommate, someone she can talk with, she said there isn?t anyone.  I suggested that she call the md office and tell them she needs clarification on her condition/treatment/prognosis.  She said she has BEEN calling, and getting nowhere.  I asked what could I do to help her, she said she just wanted to be in compliance so that she doesn?t have any more money taken out of her paycheck, that she would give me whatever information I needed, but she didn?t ask other people to help her out.  She said several times that if ?they don?t care then I don?t care anymore either.?  She was crying and upset- she told me the best thing I could do for her was to have a good day.  She said I can call her often as I need to, then told me to have a good day and she hung up the phone.

5/20/2013  Member called, she states is doing fairly well.  She uses a nebulizer tid , as well as symbicort and Spiriva to manage her COPD, as well as an inhaler for breakthrough symptoms.  She takes synthroid for hypothyroidism, has been on the same dose for many years.  She sees her md regularly, and has had the same one (MD) for many years. 
She does still smoke but is smoking less than one pack per day- she was smoking 3-5 packs per day at one time.  She continues to work on this.
 Her greatest concern right now is her weight.  She doesn?t know what to do to try and lose weight.   Her physician decreased one of her sleep meds (she has insomnia) to try and help with the weight issues.    She has gained 40 pounds in the past ten years (she was 115 pounds, now 155), although she doesn?t eat much, and what she does eat isn?t what she would think is ?bad? foods.  
Her typical daily diet:   She doesn?t eat breakfast.  Has coffee only , without sugar.  On break she has a cereal bar.  For lunch she has a bagel and cream cheese, wth iced coffee.  And for dinner she has a meat, a vegetable , and usually rice or stuffing.  
Encouraged her to eat breakfast, to start her metabolism, and it should include a lean source of protein- maybe an omelette with lean Canadian bacon/ham.  And for lunch, a salad with grilled chicken -  again, working toward taking in less carbohydrate and more protein.  With dinner, she  can have rice but change from white to brown rice, and change from white to whole grain bread for when she does eat bread.  Discussed minimizing starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas).  
She has an exercise bike that she will start using, beginning with fifteen minutes a day.  She has not been doing this.  Encouraged her that with the dietary changes, and the added exercise, she should be able to reduce her weight.  Encouraged her to visit sparkpeople.com to help her plan meals.

3/18/2013   Talked with member on phone.  She works as a cook, gets up at 230 am to be at work at 4 or 4:30.  States she is doing fairly well at this time- she was hospitalized twice last year, with COPD the first time and pneumonia the second time.  She is now struggling to pay the hospital bills and also pay for her medications, particularly the advair she takes.  States she had been  smoking up to 2 packs per day, with the help of wellbutrin she is down to � pack per day or less.  She started walking and watching her diet better, has lost 9 � pounds in the past 2-3 months.  The COPD symptoms are not as severe since she lost the weight and cut back on cigarettes.  Currently she is taking pravastatin, wellbutrin, advair, albuterol prn- but hasn?t used the albuterol in a couple of months.  She has a new grandbaby, and is excited about him.  She has been dealing with the death of a friends son, states her friend was having a hard time and she was trying to be there to help her any way she can.  
She doesn?t check bs every day, not currently on any diabetes medication.  Had labs done recently at md but cannot remember what A1C was.  Encouraged her to monitor bs daily, esp first thing in the morning, and keep a record to take to her md at next appt (next month).  
Congratulated member on increasing her exercise, losing weight, and watching her diet, encouraged her to  continue with her efforts to improve her health.  She is very stressed with trying to pay her hospital bills- she felt pressured by the hospital to pay more than she can afford to pay, and some months it was coming down to either paying the hospital bill or buying her medication.  Encouraged her to contact patient financial services- to see if there is any help available.  Member does not have a computer at home but can access one at a friends  - will send her some websites to search to find assistance with prescriptions.

Dear Ms. Hendrick,
I really enjoyed talking with you today.  I did find several websites I would encourage you to visit, hopefully you can find some assistance through one of them.
I would start with the physician- let him know that you are having to choose between paying bills and buying medication.  Maybe he can offer some ideas for assistance.  And your pharmacist- they often have information about medication assistance programs.  
Some of the websites I found:  
Partnership For Prescription Assistance
RxAssist.org
RxHope.com
GSKAccess
GSKForYou

If you google Advair, Advair coupon, Advair discount, glaxosmithklineadvair, you will find many more websites.  I hope this information helps, I wish you the best.  If I can help you with anything else please call me. KWellsRN

4/24/2013  Called member, she is doing well at this time.  She hasn?t had opportunity yet to go online to check resources I sent her to help with her advair.  She did to go the library but the computers are always tied up.  She did call some of the companies I sent her numbers for but said she got the runaround.  She has an adequate supply of advair at this time.  She is stressing over paying a hospital bill from last year, states she has insurance but she is having to make small monthly payments to cover her part of the bill, and the hospital is calling her, demanding that she pay much more than she is able to pay.  This is a concern for her.  Encouraged her again to go to patient financial services to inquire as to whether they can work with her on the balance, or if there may be a charity program that can help.  
She has lost another 4 pounds and continues to follow a heart healthy diet.  She stated she feels great.  Encouraged her to keep doing the good things she is doing, and enjoy the outdoors.  Her daughter lives next door and walks daily, encouraged her to go with her daughter as much as possible.

5/1/2013  Member returned my call.  She is working on losing weight.  Current weight is 185, her goal is 150.  She is walking on her treadmill 3-4 times a week, long enough to become a little out of breath, and breaking a sweat.  She has a family history of diabetes and wants to do what she can to prevent it.  Her fbs in May of 2012 was 105, she doesn?t know her A1c.  She has already made the switch to whole grains, and eats fruits and vegetables.  She buys her meats from an organic farm, a half a pig and a quarter of a cow, and chickens, to last through the year.  
Congratulated her on having stopped smoking ten years ago.  And on regular exercise- stressed that this is key to keeping weight and blood sugar under control.  She gardens (plants peppers, tomatoes, green beans, lettuce, cucumbers) but hasn?t set it out yet because of the rains.  She is looking forward to doing this.  
Encouraged her to keep a food diary, and look at what she is eating, to see where she can make the most effective changes.  She makes a fruit smoothie in the morning, with frozen fruits, fat free yogurt, and peanut butter.  Encouraged her to have a lean protein source at every meal.  We discussed hidden sources of sugar-  in sodas, fruit juices, fast food, processed foods.  She would like education about diet sent to her in the mail.  Sent the following information:  Tips for a Healthier You; Why Should I Lose Weight?;  Protect Your Heart:  Cook with Heart Healthy Foods;  Fruits- Nutrition Facts;  What About Eating Out;  First Steps for Fitness.  Will follow up with member in 6-8 weeks.  
Sent member the following letter:

She continues to take the simvastatin and is tolerating it well.  She recently decreased her hours at work from 40 to 32, states the decrease has really helped her stress level and her bp.  She walks around the lake, which is about a 3 mile walk, regularly.   She sees her dr regularly, and will be starting on allergy shots soon.  She said recently she was an immunologist and was tested for lupus but it turned out she does not have lupus, but does have Shogruns syndrome.  She is managing well with this, and feels the allergy shots will help with symptoms.    KWellsRN

"Received call from member, she is unhappy because she has had money taken out of her check for being non-compliant in the health and wellness program.  Directed her to contact the human resources department  about this.  She also has her paperwork for the new years biometric screening, and is not happy about having to complete it because she already  knows she is diabetic, she has been for over twenty years, and she sees her md at the Cleveland Clinic every six months for checkups.    Explained that she has the option of not participating.   She would rather participate than pay the fee.  She has an appointment in June or July, she couldn?t remember, and will have her sheet filled out at that visit.  Reminded her that is fine, she has until the December 31, 2103 deadline to get that information in.  
She uses an insulin pump, and her fbs usually run about 100.  She wasn?t absolutely sure of the exact number of her last  a1c but said it is usually around 9.    She does go to the gym, not as regularly as she would like, but she uses the treadmill there.  She follows a heart healthy diet.  Encouraged her to continue to move toward increasing her exercise, to help keep her a1c in check, as well as monitoring her carbohydrate intake.  She said she has seen ?hundreds? of dieticians over the years and is very well versed in managing her diet.

5/28/2013  1005  Called member to review KYN results.  She is pleased with her results, with the exception of her bp.  She has already seen her md with her KYN packet.  Her bp in the office is up sometimes, down other times.  Her diastolic number tends to run around the 90 mark.  The md didn?t want to change her med this time, she is going to try and lose ten pounds and see if it helps.  She has not exercised regularly over the past year, and has just started walking again- 2-3 times a week, briskly, for 20-30 minutes at the time.  She eats a heart healthy diet.  She will cut portions and increase her exercise to lose the weight.  Will check back with her in two months to cheer her progress .  Emailed member the following:  Fruit Nutritional Chart, Vegetable Nutritional Chart.

Thanks that information is interesting.  How many grams of sugar are you suppose to have a day?  It seems to me if I eat three portions of fruit a day I may exceed what I should be having.  Is natural sugar better than processed sugar?  Thanks for your time.
My reply:  I  found some helpful information  on the American Heart Association website;  search for ?sugars and carbohydrates?.  There is a difference naturally occurring sugars and processed/added sugars.  There is greater concern with the consumption of ?added? sugars than naturally occurring sugars.   Check out the website, hope it is helpful.  There is a good amount of information.  
Have a great afternoon!

Talked with member on the phone, he states he has had cholesterol issues for years, and that it runs in his family.  He was on statin medication years ago but was unable to tolerate it because of side effects.  He now eats a heart healthy diet, and exercises daily.  He feels very well prepared with diet knowledge, with regard to what he should and should not eat.  His older brother is a physician and keeps him in the know about healthy diet practices.

5/2/2013  1245  Member called to review KYN Results.  She takes bp medication and lipid lowering medication, can?t remember the names of her medications but has been on both for several years.  She states her cholesterol in the past was much higher than it is now, because of the medication.  She does have a bp monitor at home.  States her bp is usually in the same range that it was at screening.  She keeps a record of her readings and takes them with her to the doctor when she goes.  There is no history of diabetes in her family.  She started an exercise program at work last month, is walking briskly 3-5 times a week with coworkers.  She would like to lose 30 pounds in the next year but is feeling frustrated because she isn?t seeing any success as of yet.  We discussed her diet- encouraged her to keep a journal over the next several days of what she eats, and then look at what she is taking in, that will help her know what may need to be changed.  We reviewed what she had eaten all day yesterday, and most of her intake was carbohydrates.  She is eating healthy foods (cottage cheese, fruits, oatmeal) but isn?t taking in much lean protein.  Her goal in losing the 30 pounds is to feel better. Commended her on the efforts she is taking already, encouraged her not to give up, that it hasn?t been that long since she started exercising.  Encouraged her to continue tweaking her plan, to add in some resistance training/weight training?she and her coworkers are going to add the exercise bands to their walking.  
We discussed the importance of changing from white bread/pasta/potatoes to whole grains, increasing non starchy vegetables.  Emailed member the following educational materials:  All About Carb Counting;  Non Starchy Vegetables;  Pre-Diabetes, Getting Started;  Tips for a Healthier You.     KWells, RN

6/3/2013  Received the following email that was sent 5/28/2013 by member, I was out of town screening-
I am sorry I missed your calls.  I work until 4:30 or 5:00.  I am usually so busy during the day to try and call.   I did receive the results in the mail and had just had all of the same tests done in my doctor's office the month prior to the AIA screening.  I am extremely interested in smoking cessation options that are available.  I have tried chantix, which I am not able to use and  have tried the patch which did not work for me.   I did see where there were some other options available via prescription which I had intended to speak with my doctor about.   
I thank you for calling and will try and get in touch with as soon as I can.
My reply:  Thank you for replying.  I was out of the office at the end of last week, screening in Pennsylvania, so I have just received your message.  I checked to make sure you were on the list to receive smoking cessation information.  I have attached some information that is interesting about how quickly your body begins to recover once you stop smoking.  
Maybe it would be best to set up a time to talk by phone, I can stay later one afternoon if need be.  It only takes a few minutes to review your Know Your Number results.  Just let me know when is good for you.  Hope you have a great week!

She has been on synthroid for many years, she takes 100mcg daily.  Her md follows her levels regularly.  She and her coworkers have been walking frequently at work.  Congratulated her on her great lab values.  She recently had shoulder surgery- a rotator cuff tear repaired  and spur removed.  She said she feels she is about 95% recovered.  She wants to get back to some weight training, will advance under her physicians guidance.  She follows a heart healthy diet.  We discussed ways to cut carbohydrates, this may help with reducing weight.  Encouraged her to continue her efforts to improve her health.  KWells,RN

5/20/2013  Called member, reviewed KYN results.  She has already been to her MD, who put her on atorvastatin for her cholesterol.  She has been working on trying to lose some weight- she is currently at 215 pounds, and would like to reach a goal weight of 170 pounds.  She eats a heart healthy diet, exercises by running 3 miles a day 3-4 times per week.  She isn?t finding success in losing any weight.  She joined a gym two years ago and hired a personal trainer- with regular exercise and strength training she got minimal results, and finally quit going.  
 Her md has run some thyroid tests.  She has been experiencing frequent fatigue.   She can?t remember the exact number but her results were on the ?low end? of normal .  She was unsure if this was the TSH, or a T4 level.  
  We discussed making some changes in her diet, decreasing carbohydrates, increasing lean protein.  She will continue to exercise and will be following up with her MD about the thyroid results.  Will check back with her in six weeks.  ---KWells,RN

I?m sorry I haven?t responded to you sooner but I?ve been extremely busy at work and just haven?t gotten a chance to call.  If you could just email be right now your thoughts regarding my results I?d appreciate it.  I see that my cholesterol is high but it looks like that?s because my HDL is high and my LDL is low which I thought would be a good thing.  Just so you know my HDL has always been high.  I know my pulse and blood pressure is a little high but I?m the one that was extremely nervous when you were taking my blood pressure.  Let me know your thoughts.  I?m off � day today and all day tomorrow.
My email response:
Hello! 
Thank you for your reply, I do understand how busy things can be.  I don?t mind at all  communicating via email. The law requires that your personal health information be protected, so  I will send you an email following this one that will be encrypted.  You will be prompted to set up a password that will allow you to open the encrypted email containing your results.  Let me know when you have set up the password, then I can send you the results. I?m looking forward to working with you!
Sent the following encrypted message:
Once you have the password set up, please send me a message and I will send your results.
Thank you.
---KWells,RN

5/15/2013  Received email that member has set up her password.  Send her the following encrypted results:
Good morning!
Your results are as follows:

Test					Your result			Desired Value
Fasting Blood Sugar  			102				100 or less
HbA1c					5.5                                                    Below  5.7
Blood Pressure				127/88				120/80 or below
Total Cholesterol			278  				Below 200
HDL (High Density Lipoprotein)           	142				Above 40
LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein)   	124				Below 100
Triglycerides				59				Below 150

The fasting blood sugar shows what your blood sugar is at the time it is drawn.  The HBA1c gives a better picture of what your blood sugar has averaged over the past 2-3 months.  Your HbA1c is in the normal range.  

It is preferable to have your systolic pressure  (the top number) at or below 120, so you are very close.  Your diastolic pressure (the bottom number) ideally should be at or below 80.  Have you by chance had your blood pressure rechecked since the screening?  Sometimes we find that bps are elevated at the screening because a member may be a bit anxious about the blood draw, or perhaps they had to run up the stairs to get in to the screening- any number of reasons can elevate the blood pressure.  

Your HDL  (high density lipoproteins), the GOOD cholesterol, is GREAT!   Congratulations!

Your total cholesterol is elevated, at 278.  This can be related to diet, but can also be a familial tendency.  Do you have family members with elevated cholesterol?

There are some things you can do that can help reduce your cholesterol and LDL.  
They include:
*Diet:  Fiber is not absorbed by the body.  It absorbs cholesterol and fat and takes it away.  So when you eat carbohydrates, try adding some whole grains, such as whole wheat toast, brown rice, whole wheat multi grain crackers or bagels.  It is to your advantage to switch from white products- white rice, white bread, white pastas, to whole grain products.  

Eat more fish high in omega?3 fatty acids instead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish, like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega-3 fatty acids.  

Keep in mind that fresh fruits and vegetables have great amounts of fiber.  They keep you full, provide vitamins and nutients vital to nerves and blood vessels, and balance out your diet.  

EXERCISE is one of the BEST ways to help control/ reduce cholesterol.  Even just ten minutes, three times a day is helpful.  Do you have a regular exercise routine?  What does it include?

Have you seen your physician yet to review your results, and if so, did he/she make any recommendations based on your numbers?

I look forward to your response!  Have a great day!

----KWells,RN

5/17/2013  Member called to review KYN results.  He is participating in a ?biggest loser? program at work and since April 1 has lost 27.2 pounds.  Congratulated him on his weight loss!  He has increased his water intake, decreased diet sodas from 1or 2 per day to 1 or 2 per week, and has noticed that they don?t taste good anymore.  He has stopped eating any fast food, decreased portions, eating less carbs and more lean protein.  He exercises on his treadmill 3-5 times per week, and also does the WII Fit.  He has rechecked his bp, it is running 124-126/low 80s.  He is working toward seeing it drop to 120/80.  His motivation is the family history of heart disease/high blood pressure.  His father died young of a massive heart attack.    His target weight is 200-220lbs.  He has not seen his md yet but will do so, with his KYN packet.  Will follow up with him in July to check his progress, and see if he won the biggest loser contest.

5/8/2013  1700  Returned call from member.  He has looked through his packet and noticed that his triclyerides are elevated.  He has recently started to exercise again- walking his dog,  using his exercise bike, and doing stretches and situps.  He walks the golf course par threes instead of riding the golf cart.  He is 2 yrs s/p a knee replacement, and doesn?t jog anymore because of this.  The knee doesn?t hurt him , it isn?t problematic now, but he doesn?t feel good about stressing it like that.  
He does take blood pressure and cholesterol medications- he would like to be able to stop taking these, that is his goal.   
Diabetes does run in his family.  We discussed the ADA guidelines for a1c of 5.8 being in the moderate risk category.  He wants to be proactive in doing all he can to prevent diabetes.  We discussed making the change from white products to whole grains, adding fiber in the diet, eating more vegetables and fruits.  He would like a follow up call in one month.

She rechecked her bp at home and I was lower than at the screening, she couldn?t remember the exact number.  She takes a diuretic and would like to avoid having to take any other bp medicine.  She does exercise 2-3 times per week, but has bad knees so she is limited to cycling or something that is low impact.  Walking becomes very uncomfortable if she walks quickly enough to increase her heart rate.   Water aerobics isn?t a possibility for her.   She would like to increase her exercise and lose weight this year.  She is going to try and get an exercise bike to aid in her efforts.  She is well versed in a heart healthy diet.  Discussed the benefits of cutting carbohydrates and increasing lean protein.   She is eating whole grains whenever possible.  Is interested in receiving nutrition information via email, things that will help her in meal planning.  Sent her the following email:
 Hello!  It was great talking with you yesterday.   I have attached some nutritional information that I have found helpful in meal planning.  I try to start with a lean protein, and build the  side dishes around it.  There is some information about healthy snacks also.  
You may enjoy  www.sparkpeople.com  - it is a website that helps you plan meals that include foods you like, while taking into account your weight loss goals.  Let me know what you think of it.

He and his wife had their second child eight months ago, and their new daughter hasn?t slept through the night until just a couple of weeks ago.  He wasn?t sleeping /resting well at night and was very tired during the day so he started drinking lots of sodas- 5 or 6 a day.  He was snacking on things he doesn?t normally eat.  He noticed that he had gained 20 pounds by the time January arrived.  He knew he needed to make some changes.  He started by changing the sodas to water or tea.  He has made one change at the time to decrease his sugar and caffeine intake, and recently started using a ten minute daily workout plan.  He is excited that he has lost thirteen pounds, and is feeling much better.  
His bp at the dr.s office was 117/78.  He follows a heart healthy diet and is looking forward to his next md appt in two months, to see how his labs have improved.

5/10/2013  Member returned my call.  He has a brother and father with diabetes.  We discussed the ADA guidelines that place his a1c of 5.7 in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  In talking with him about his regular diet, he was eating pop tarts frequently.  We discussed the nutritional value  of the frosted cherry poptarts --  he eats two at the time, there are 76 grams of carbohydrates, 400 calories, 32 grams of sugar in two pop tarts. He thought they were good for you, because the box says they are fortified with vitamins/minerals.    He is also eating pre-sweetened cereals for breakfast.  He has switched to reduced fat milk.  Encouraged him to change from white products to whole grains, snack on fruit or almonds instead of pop tarts, and to switch to a non pre-sweetened cereal.  Commended him on changing to low fat milk.  
He does not have any regular exercise routine, he does a lot of lifting at work.  Recognized that even though this is hard work, it isn?t as beneficial as walking, for reducing the A1C and improving heart health.  Encouraged him to start taking a brisk walk several times a week.  
He is receptive to receiving educational materials in the mail- sent the following  via mail:

He sees his md every six months to check on his bp- states it usually runs 114-188/70s.  He is trying to lose some weight.  He has gotten a nutriblender  and is making a healthy shake for dinner each day.  He is enjoying this and feels it is something he can stick with.  He doesn?t always eat breakfast- encouraged him to eat breakfast, with a  lean source of protein, to get his metabolism started in the morning.  He said he may or not eat lunch- it might be a salad, it might be a cheeseburger.  He said he knows what to do, but he doesn?t always do it, with regard to eating healthy. 
Congratulated him on taking steps to begin changing his diet, and encouraged him to continue working toward changing one meal at a time, so that the change is easier to tolerate and will become habit.  
He would like to get to a goal weight of 300 pounds this year.  He is hampered in his efforts to exercise because of two bad knees- his right knee has been replaced 4 times he reports.   I suggested maybe water aerobics/exercise, but he said there is no place close enough for him to go do this.  Suggested maybe using stretchy bands to help work upper body muscles, and encouraged him to walk as much as possible.  Will follow up with member in two months to evaluate his progress.

2013  Member called.  He had a colonoscopy today, tolerated it well.  He did see his MD after the screening.  He stated the screening was a real wakeup call for him- he looked at his elevated blood sugar and A1c, and bp- and knew he needed to work on his health.  He has started walking and biking again, and has cut his mountain dew from 20 ounces a day to 12- working on cutting it out completely.  Discussed the ADA guidelines indicating an A1c of 6.1 is in the moderate risk category for developing diabetes.  Discussed ways to reduce the A1c.  Encouraged him to continue to exercise regular, congratulated him on his recent 4 pound weight loss.  He is snacking on fruit now instead of prepackaged cakes/cookies, etc.  He doesn?t eat fast food.  He takes medications for elevated bp (acupril, HCTZ) and cholesterol.  Will start eating non pre-sweetened cereal for breakfast.  Encouraged him to check his bp at home (has  monitor) and keep a record of readings so he can take with him to the md at his next check up.  Encouraged him to keep up the great work, and to call me with any questions.  Mailed him the following:  You Don?t Have to Knock Yourself Out to Prevent Diabetes

Emailed member:  Certainly we can communicate via email.  The law requires that personal health information be protected, so I will need to send your results in an encrypted email.  I will send you an email that will guide you to set up a password so you can access the email containing the results.  Hope you have a great day!
KWellsRN
4/9/2013  Received notice from member that he has set up a password.  Sent the following email encrypted:  Good morning! I hope you are having a super day!
  Your results are as follows:  
Fasting Blood Sugar			100			This is the amount of sugar you have circulating in your blood at the time of the
								Screening.  A normal value is less than 100.

Hemoglobin A1c			5.6			This value indicates what your blood sugar has averaged over the past 2-3 months.
								The American Diabetes Association guidelines state that an A1c between 5.7
								And 6.4 indicates a moderate risk to develop diabetes.  An A1c of 5.6 and below is 
								Considered normal.

Cholesterol				210	Elevated	A desirable level is less than 200.  

Triglycerides				105			The desired level is below 150.  

HDL Cholesterol 			53			This is the 'good cholesterol'- high density lipoprotein.  Anything over 39
								Is considered good.  The 50-60 range is very good.  Congratulations!

LDL					136	Elevated	This is the 'bad cholesterol'-  low density lipoprotein.  The desired level 
								Is below 100.  

Blood Pressure				179/104     ELEVATED	  A normal blood pressure is  120/80 or less.  


These  results were faxed to your physician for follow up. The greatest concern at this time is your blood pressure- it is very high.   This is definitely something you will need to follow up with your physician about.  It may be that your blood pressure was just elevated that one time, but it is possible also that you could have untreated hypertension, which can damage your organs. 

Your cholesterol was slightly elevated- there are some things that you can do to help decrease this number to below the 200 threshold.  Adding fiber to your diet is a great way to reduce cholesterol.  Fiber is not absorbed by the body, it absorbs cholesterol and fat and takes them away.  So when you eat carbohydrates, try adding some whole grains, such as whole wheat toast, brown rice, whole wheat multi gain crackers or bagels.  Weight loss also lowers triglyderides and cholesterol.  Exercise is one of THE best ways to reduce cholesterol.  

I don?t know if you eat fast food or processed/prepackaged/fried  foods, or if you eat out frequently  but all these things are high in fat, calories, and cholesterol.  Minimizing your intake of these items can really make a difference in your cholesterol levels.  
 
Having said all that,  I do have a couple of questions: What do you typically eat for breakfast?  Lunch? Dinner?  What do you drink- soda or sweet tea, fruit juices, water, etc?  What kind of exercise do you do each week?  Has your blood pressure ever been elevated in the past?  
I look forward to hearing back from you. :)

"0955  Called member to review KYN results- bs 104, a1c 5.7, bp 128/85, tchol 202, hdl 50, ldl 130, tri 109. Left message for member to please return my call, I will be in the office until 6pm tonight.  KWells,RN
5/10/2013  Called, left message for member to return my call so we may review KYN results.  KWells,RN
5/14/2013  Member returned my call.  He reports his mother and most of her family had diabetes.  He tries to watch his sugar intake.  Discussed the ADA guidelines that place his a1c of 5.7 in the moderate risk category.  He agrees that he wants to take steps to help prevent the development of diabetes.  Discussed decreasing intake of concentrated simple sugars (sodas, cakes, sweets, etc.).  Encouraged him to change from white bread/white rice/ white pasta to whole grain products.  He eats salmon often instead of red meat.  He does walk nightly with his dogs.  He recently started lifting weights again.  He has some issues with his shoulder joint so he has to be careful with lifting- he said his ball is worn down pretty badly and the doctor has talked about shoulder joint replacement but he isn?t ready to do that yet.  He also has worn knees, but isn?t ready to have them replaced either.  
He has a bp monitor at home but doesn?t check his pressure very often.  Encouraged him to do so, several times a week, and keep a record of the readings, then take them to his physician when he goes.  This can help his MD in evaluating the effectiveness of his medications and adjusting dosages if necessary.  
He had esophageal surgery a couple years ago to correct severe reflux issues.  He is careful now to chew his food thoroughly and eat slowly.  He doesn?t eat spicy foods.  
Discussed the benefits of cardio exercise.  Encouraged him to walk briskly several times a week, starting for about 10 minutes at the time and gradually build up to longer walks.  
He selected as a goal that he maintain his regular exercise, and add in walking 2-3 times a week.  He used to walk more but only walks with the dogs now.  Will work toward a more brisk pace.

4/12/2013  Called member to review KYN results.  bp at screening was 178/120.  He was in a tremendous amount of pain at that time due to a hernia.  He had surgery last week  to repair the hernia (abdominal) and states his bp was back to normal at the hospital. States he is doing well post op, is just sore.  His pain meds are working well for him.   He didn?t remember the exact reading but it was better.  Reviewed his bs 100 and a1c 5.8- discussed ADA guidelines that qualify an a1c of 5.8 in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  Discussed that it would be to his advantage to take a look at his diet and make some changes now that could prevent that number from increasing in the future.  He does drink regular sodas.  Encouraged to change to sugar free or just drink water.  He doesn?t typically eat breakfast, and has been eating just a pack of crackers for lunch lately because he was in such pain he couldn?t eat much at the time.  Reviewed chol 227, ldl 147, hdl 48.  Discussed adding fiber to his diet by switching to whole grain bread and brown rice, whole wheat multi grain crackers or bagels, fresh fruits and vegetables , and also exercising when he is healed more. He said he knows he needs to lose some weight.   He walks for exercise- is not walking as much right now because of the surgery but will resume when he is healed.

5/2/2013  1615  Talked with member, he reports that he had a sister that actually passed away from diabetes because  she did not take care of herself.  We talked about his fbs 98, A1c of 6.0 and reviewed the ADA guidelines that puts an a1c of 5.7-6.4 in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  He reports that he knows he doesn?t eat right he just isn?t sure where to begin or what to do first.  He doesn?t eat much during the day- just snacks from the machine at work- Tasty Cakes, etc.  Encouraged him to bring a snack from home- a piece of fruit, instead of the processed high fat foods in the machine.  He doesn?t drink sodas, usually drinks hot tea in the mornings (he adds sugar to this- suggested that he use splenda or no sugar at all instead), and drinks water the rest of the day.  We discussed adding lean protein at each meal (boiled eggs ?eat only the whites- at breakfast, whole grain toast, half an apple/orange;  tuna on whole grain bread for lunch with celery/carrots, etc.  He said dinner at home is usually a healthy meal ? they eat very little red meat, mostly chicken or fish, grilled, and they have non-starchy vegetables.  He doesn?t eat well during the day, then when he gets home from work, he eats everything he can find?usually sweets.  He acknowledged that he knows he needs to cut out the sweets.  
We discussed the benefit of regular exercise to help control/lower blood sugars.  He hasn?t been exercising lately like he used to.  He and his wife did take a nice long walk last night, commended him on this, encouraged him to make this a habit- at least three times a week, and to walk briskly.  
He also has gout, and has been off his medicine for about a week- just hasn?t had it refilled yet- and is having pain in his feet.  He will be filling his medication ASAP.
He does not have a bp monitor at home, encouraged him to get one and record his bp in the mornings and at night, and take this information to his MD when he goes in.  We discussed how the dietary changes and increase in exercise would help lower not only blood sugar but his cholesterol and his triglycerides as well, and he will probably lose some weight.  He realizes that he doesn?t want his A1c to become any higher.    
Commended him for his willingness to make changes, and encouraged him to start out changing one thing at the time. He has an MD appt May 23.  He is going to work on adding some lean protein to every meal.

Member called to review his KYN results.  He has been diabetic for four years, takes glimiperide, and takes a cholesterol med also but doesn't remember which one.  his bs at screening was 172, a1c was 7.  He does check his bs at home daily, states it has been running in the 130s lately.  He sees his md again in September for checkup.  He does get regular diabetic foot exams, and diabetic eye exams.  He is interested in exercising/walking again so that he can lose some weight and bring his a1c down some, regulate his blood sugars.  He plans to start walking again, encouraged him to proceed slowly and build up his tolerance.  Reviewed ways to increase the HDL.

5/17/2013  Member called to review KYN results.  He and his wife used to walk regularly, but because of a knee problem, and back surgery, they have gotten away from it.  He has gained 20+ pounds now, and is ready to get back to exercising. They do follow a heart healthy diet but have slipped somewhat.  Encouraged him to remember that its not where you start, its where you finish- and ?do-overs? are always a possibility.  
He sees his md every six months.  His bp was checked last week after an accident at work caused him to go to get ten stitches in his head- it was 117/80.  Hi head is healing nicely.  
We discussed making the change to whole grain products instead of white rice/bread/potatoes/pasta, increasing fruits/vegetables.  
Currently his father is in the hospital, not doing well at all, with blocked arteries.  Member is motivated to prevent this in himself.  He is willing to get back to regular exercise and improving his diet. Sent the following information via email:  Cholesterol TLC;  Vegetable Nutrition Chart;  Fish Nutrition Chart;  Fruit Nutrition Chart;  GET REAL!  You Don?t Have To Knock Yourself Out to Prevent Diabetes!.  Will follow up in six weeks to see how he is doing and keep him encouraged!!

"4/2/2013  1122     Talked with member regarding KYN results:  bs 163, A1c 6.8, Tchol 240, tri 466, hdl 36, bp 147/96.  Member doesn?t recall being excessively thirsty or going to urinate any more than often.  States she has gained about 30 pounds in the past year and has found it very difficult to lose the weight.  Discussed the potential effects of elevated blood sugars such as kidney and eye damage, neuropathy.  Member understands follow up is necessary as soon as possible, will call md today for appt, and call me back after the appt.  Encouraged member that this is a manageable condition, she has a positive outlook and is willing to do whatever she needs to do to improve her health.  KWellsRN
4/4/2013  Member called, she has scheduled md appt for 4/29.  Would like me to fax her a copy of the lab results just in case she gets to the md office and they cannot locate the copy I faxed to them.  Faxed labs to member.    KWellsRN
5/22/2013  Called member to check her progress- left her a message to return my call.  KWells,RN
5/22/2013  Talked with member- she saw her MD in April, and had already started making changes in her diet between the time she and I talked 4/2/13 and the appt 4/29.  When her dr repeated her labs on that visit,  her cholesterol had dropped by twenty points already.  He instructed her to make some dietary changes, and then come back to repeat the labs in three months.  He was particularly concerned with her triglycerides.  She has since then started  being very careful about reading labels on everything she eats.  She drinks almost NO soda- has one once in a great while.  Otherwise she drinks water.  She takes in no added salt or sugar, and avoids sweets/processed foods.  She eats out on occasion and usually has salad,  with no added cheese,  with dressing on the side.  
  She is using a fitbit to help  monitor her activity level each day, and usually reaches her goal of 10,000 steps.  If she is close, then she will push herself to reach it.  It helps make her accountable.  
She is eating a heart healthy diet.  She is very excited about the changes she has made and is looking forward to seeing what her labs are when she goes back to have them repeated in July.  I will follow up with her after that visit. 
Emailed the following information to member:  Tips to Reduce Tryglycerides.

"5/7/2013  Talked with member, she saw her MD yesterday.  He was pleased with her results, as they are better than the labs he had drawn back in January of this year.  Member is excited about this.  She has lost 20 pounds in the past year and continues to work toward losing 20 more.  She is making changes to her eating habits slowly, one thing at a time. She suffers from occasional anxiety and said she does better with changing slowly.  
 She is now eating whole grains instead of white products, and is using extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil when cooking.  She is eating more fresh vegetables.  States it has been difficult for her to change her diet because she didn?t grow up eating healthy- always had meat and potatoes, not so many vegetables.    Congratulated her on her successful weight loss, encouraged her to keep up the great work!  Encouraged her to add exercise to her routine, she stated she doesn?t like exercise but does enjoy being active outdoors, working in the yard.  Suggested that she maybe just try a brisk walk three or four times per week.  Receptive to receiving educational information via email.  Sent the following information via email:  How Can I Cook Healthfully,  Tips for a Healthier You,  Vegetable Nutrition Chart, Fruit Nutrition Chart.

5/8/2013  Member returned call.  He quit smoking  one month ago. He developed chest pain at work and wasn?t feeling well, so he went to the hospital and was diagnosed with blockages (80%, 50%, 20%, 30%).  He had one stent placed.  He is feeling much better now, is back at work. He is on blood pressure and cholesterol medication, can?t remember the names of the meds at this time.  
He used to be very active working in his yard, but cannot do that now.  He wants to start back walking.  Encouraged him to talk with his physician before beginning to exercise.  His follow up appt is at the end of this month. 
We discussed his a1c of 6.3, and reviewed the ADA guidelines that place this value in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  He doesn?t know his family history, he was adopted.  He has been working on improving his diet, decreasing red meats and fats.  Discussed changing to whole grains, adding fresh fruits and vegetables to his diet. 
Congratulated member on having quit smoking.  Encouraged him to take good care of himself by following a heart healthy diet, and talking with his physician about exercise.    
Emailed member the following information:   Cholesterol TLC ,  How Can I Cook Healthfully?
Will follow up in a month to check on member.  KWells,RN
6/7/2013 Talked with member, he is doing well per his report, is very proud that he has been 8 weeks without smoking!  Congratulated him on this- encouraged him to keep up the great work.  It bothers him a little that he is picking up some weight.  He does walk his dog regularly, but isn?t really at a brisk pace.  Asked him to talk with his md about an appropriate exercise regimen.  There is a cardiac rehab program available in his area, he opted not to take part, but may consider it now.  Encouraged him to talk with his physician about this.  Exercise is a very important part of his recovery.  He is starting to be a bit more active, does some light lifting, but when he feels a twinge in his chest it unnerves him.  I pointed out that this is a good reason to consider the  cardiac rehab program,  where he is supervised and guided through an exercise regimen that is beneficial without being too taxing.  
He is noticing that his coughing has decreased, and that food tastes better, since stopping smoking.  He is even talking to people at work stressing to them that they need to quit.  
He is uncertain as to whether his md has repeated his a1c (it was 6.3 at screening).  Encouraged him to ask at his next appt, and review his KYN results with the md.  
Emailed member the following information:  Within 20 minutes of quitting;  Clearing the Air;  Fruit Nutritional Chart; Fish Nutritional Chart; Vegetable Nutritional Chart.  Will follow up in six weeks with him.  ---KWells,RN

We  review each lab result, then make recommendations to help improve the numbers as needed.  Lab results  include fasting blood sugar, Hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides.  It only takes a few minutes, but if phone time is difficult to come by, I don?t mind emailing  your results.
EM from member: Yes I have all of that from the packet that was sent, no need to send it again.  Anything specifically you wanted to point out?
My response:  Yes, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL.
 EM from member:  Send your recommendations.

Hello!
Just checking to see if you did receive the email I sent on May 28, that guides you through setting up a password.  If you have not received it please let me know, I will re-send it.  
Thank you,

Received this response from member:  Yes I received your e-mail and no I'm not setting up an encrypted whatever.
My email response:  
I understand.  It does seem like a lot of trouble.  Unfortunately the law will not allow transmission of protected health information online without the encryption protection in place.  
 I will be more than happy to review your results with you on the phone if you like.  It truly only takes a few minutes.  If you would like to do this, I can be reached at 877-503-0388, extension 240.

6/3/2013  Spoke with member, reviewed KYN results.  bs-94, a1c-5.9, bp 138/97, tchol 269, hdl 44, ldl 178, tri 237.  He works out nearly every day- approx. 2 hours of jujitsu.  He has not had his bp rechecked since the screening, but does recall it having been elevated in the past.  He used to fight competitively, and prior to each fight , he had to have his bp checked.  It would be elevated before the fight, then go down after the fight.  He thought it was just being excited before the fight that made it go up.  
He does not have a family history of diabetes or cholesterol issues.  Discussed his a1c being in the moderate risk category according to the ADA guidelines.  He doesn?t drink sodas, or sweet tea- drinks water throughout the day.  He does eat out pretty often- pizza and sandwiches.  He had started a food journal about a month ago, and said his KYN results have just affirmed what he was thinking about changing his eating habits.  Encouraged him to change to whole grain products, decrease consumption of red meat, increase fiber in his diet, and most important, to see his md as soon as possible.  
He will see his md, I will follow up with him in two months to see what changes he has made and how its going.  Emailed member the following information:  Cholesterol TLC;  GET REAL!  You Don?t Have to Knock Yourself Out to Prevent Diabetes;  Dining Out Education Sheets.

He has been eating lots of snack cakes and chips.  He eats very little red meat, usually eats grilled turkey/chicken. He had his bp re-checked after the screening, reports that is was 120s over 80ish.  He exercises 3x week, on treadmill and stationary bike.  Discussed the ADA guidelines for a1c of 6.0 being in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  Discussed ways to decrease the a1c and fbs by decreasing his intake of carbohydrates, increasing lean protein, changing to whole grains, increasing non starchy vegetables.  He doesn?t drink alchohol, not for twenty years.  He doesn?t usually eat breakfast, encouraged him to have a light breakfast, with a source of protein, such as boiled eggs, and whole grain toast, a small serving of fruit and skim milk.  He has not yet seen his physician, encouraged him to do so.   Mailed the following educational information:  All About Carbohydrate Counting; Pre-Diabetes- getting started;  All About Pre-Diabetes.

5/3/2013	Michael Wrubel 
Member called with questions regarding diet and lowering carb intake to decrease A1c. Member asked about granola bars, Nutri-Grain bars specifically. I recommended he limit his intake of these bars to no more than 2 per day, but preferably even less than this. Member has started drinking ?Clear American Sparkling Water? from Wal-Mart. This has no carbs, artificially sweetened. Member stated that he eats a lot of bread and a lot of pasta. I recommended that he switch to whole grain breads and pastas. Informed member that he can ?treat? himself to a higher carb or less healthy choice occasionally but should limit everyday intake of sugars and simple carbs.  I recommended that he choose complex carbs over simple carbs when possible. Member asked what he should limit his carbs to every day, and I recommended he see his doctor regarding this, and ask his doctor for a daily caloric limit, and perhaps ask for a referral to a dietician or nutritionist. Member has an appointment with his MD in two weeks and will run more tests and discuss results at that time. Member?s father recently passed away due to complications from diabetes. Member has worked very hard to get his life on the right track and does not want to end up a diabetic like his dad. I let the member know that he is welcome to call us any time that he has any questions or needs some tips for healthier living.		J Womble

6/24/2013  Received notice from member that she has set up her password.  Emailed the following information in ecrypted form:
Hello, I hope you are doing well today.  Your results are as follows:
BP 			178/109, manual 150/100  *Elevated          Desired range is 120/80 or below
Glucose			79		                       	                   Desired range= less than 100
Hemoglobin A1c 	 5.8          	*Moderate risk		     Desired range= less than 5.7. According to the American Diabetes Association Guidelines, an A1c in the range of 5.7-6.4 is in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes;  An A1c of 6.5 or higher is diagnostic of diabetes.
Total Cholesterol	215 		*Elevated		     Desired range= less than 200
HDL Cholesterol		 53					     Desired range=above 39
LDL Cholesterol		123		*Elevated		     Desired range=less than 100
Triglycerides		197		*Elevated		    Desired range= less than 150

I remember you mentioned that you see a physician regularly- have you by chance seen him since the screening, and possibly rechecked your blood pressure?
What does your blood pressure usually run?  
Your blood sugar and a1c  levels are great- congratulations!
And CONGRATULATIONS on your HDL cholesterol, it is great!  
Your cholesterol , ldl cholesterol, and triglycerides are all elevated.  I noticed that you checked on your screening form that you are taking a medication to lower your cholesterol.  Is this something that you maybe just started taking recently?  Are you tolerating it well?    Or maybe the levels we are seeing now are an improvement over what your numbers were before you began taking the cholesterol medication?
Do any of your family members have high cholesterol?
Do you exercise regularly?  Exercise is important to helping reduce/control cholesterol.  
I know this is a lot of questions- thank you for taking the time to review this information.  I look forward to receiving your answers.  
Have a great day!

6/24/2013  Member is having difficulty with creating password/opening encrypted email.  Called her on the phone, reviewed her labs with her.  She had her bp rechecked at her md office, it was 140/80, the md was happy with that reading.  She has been on cholesterol medication for two years, under the supervision of her physician.  She is on an exercise program by recommendation of her MD.  Encouraged her to continue working with her physician to decrease he cholesterol,  triglycerides, and LDL.  Emailed her the following:  What are High Blood Tryglycerides and Cholesterol;  Why Cholesterol Matters.

Hey folks, 
I sent this email on June 19th. I needed to hear from you ?before? the end of June. 
There are 6 of you from whom I have not heard. 
I have to send a compliance report to HR by the end of the day. 
Please let me hear from you today! 
Thanks, 
Kim 
PS. As usual, let me know how you are doing with reaching your goals; how you are doing with healthy eating and exercise.

"Hey All, 
Hope this finds you doing well &amp;amp; taking advantage of the nice weather outside. 
This is your friendly reminder to update me on the progress you have made (&amp;amp; continue to make) on your health goal. 
Please do this before the 28th of June, since that is the last weekday of this month &amp;amp; we will be running into the 4th of July holiday the following week. 
Warm Regards, 
"
"Thank you so much Kim.  I will look over these and try to apply your tips to what I'm trying to accomplish.  I'm actually wanting to gain some wait (which is still surprising to me to say!), but it is important to me to try and do so in a healthy way.  I've been struggling with it, and hoping that some of the tips in your presentation will help with ideas of a good diet.  Being a little bit of a picky eater and convenience eater doesn't help me much!!  :) 

Anyway, thank you for sending these documents and for your presentation last week! 
"
"Gladly ......... Welcome to SIG! They are a great employer. ;o) 
I?ve attached the pp and a ?tips? sheet. 
What I recommend is that you print the tips sheet; review it; put today?s date beside any tip you are already doing; pick a new tip to apply to your life and keep adding tips (once a week or once a month, however slow or fast you want to take this). Eventually you will have accomplished them all and be living a healthy lifestyle. 
If I can help you further, please let me know. 
Warm Regards, 
Kim

"Hi Kim, 

I'm new here and attended your 10am presentation this morning.  I'm wondering if I could have a copy of the presentation to review.  I'd like to read over the food/nutrition portion because it's an area I need some assistance with, and I would like to see what you highlight generally in a presentation. 

I enjoyed the meeting this morning.  Coping/Managing stress is definitely a necessary topic in today's world.   

Thank you,

Has tried to use candy or gum.  Does not work.  Considering using lozenge or chantix.  Goal: start slowly cutting back
TOB #1
Met to do TOB #1.  She said she does want to quit.  She has a plan in place.  She is going to start taking chantix mid October.  Her quit date will be the end of October.  She has done Chantix before.  She quit for 4 months, but she was not doing it for the right reasons.  She said she is ready now and her and her husbands motivation his for their kids.  Goal: start  exercising in the morning to delay smoking

Good morning!  Your results are as follows:

Test					Your result						Desired Value
Fasting Blood Sugar   			89   -Normal				Less than 100
HbA1c                                                                   5.8   Moderate				Mild  ?less than or equal to 5.6
										Moderate -  less than or equal to 5.7-6.4
										Severe- Diagnostic of Diabetes- 6.5 or greater
										(American Diabetes Association Standards)	

Blood Pressure				114/80	Normal  			Systolic 120 or below;  Diastolic 80 or below

Total Cholesterol			213    Elevated				Below 200

HDL ?High Density Lipoprotein?		49					40 and above
(the ?good? cholesterol?

LDL ?Low Density Lipoprotein?		128					Below 100
(the ?bad? cholesterol)

Triglycerides				178					Below 150


Your fasting blood sugar is normal.  However, the hemoglobin a1c, is in the moderate risk category.  An a1c of 5.8 indicates that your blood sugar has averaged 129 for the past two to three months.  The a1c can become elevated when diet and exercise habits change.  When food intake has increased, and exercise has decreased, the a1c will rise.   
CONGRATULATIONS on a great blood pressure!!
CONGRATULATIONS on a great HDL!
Your LDL is  higher than the desired value.  
Your Triglycerides are above the desired value.

There are some things you can do to reduce the A1c, the LDL, and the Triglyceride levels.  
With regard to diet:
Add fiber to your diet.  Fiber is not absorbed by the body;  it absorbs cholesterol and fat and takes them away.  You can add fiber by adding whole grains to your diet, and changing from white bread/pasta/potatoes to whole grain products.  There are many more choices available today than in the past that include whole grains.

Any time you exercise, even ten minutes three times a day will help.

Weight loss also lowers triglycerides and cholesterol.

Alcohol consumption has strong effects on triglyceride levels.  Drinking more than one drink a day for women or two for men can raise triglyceride levels considerably.  

It is helpful to eat more fish high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega 3 fatty acids.  

Some questions to consider-
Is there any family history of diabetes?  
What are your sources of sugar/carbohydrates in your diet? Do you drink regular sodas?  If so, how often?
Are you eating lean protein with each meal? If not could you consider adding some?  Protein helps keep blood sugars stable.
Do you have a regular exercise routine?  What does it include?  Cardio exercise is great for reducing the A1c.  
If you could select a health goal (losing weight, setting up a more regular exercise routine, stop smoking,  etc) for the year, what would you choose?

I look forward to your response!


5/15/2013  Member emailed me 5/14/13 @ 2035
Hello.
I just wanted to let you know some of the things that I eat.
Every morning I have regular Cheerios with a 9 oz cup of 1% milk and a 5oz cup of Trop 50  OJ plus calcium.

Every weekday for lunch I have Jif peanut butter and Welchs grape jam on a light wheat hot dog roll and I have 3 dark chocolate Bliss along with a 16oz bottle of 4C Light Pink Lemonade.

I don't drink any alcohol or smoke.  I have one sugar free Pepsi One at supper and also have either grapes or an apple as well.

I try to have albacore tuna on light wheat toast once per week. I also eat chicken and pork chops for suppers.

My weekend lunch is Sara Lee Virgina Baked Ham with Swiss on a Wheat Kaiser Roll, 6 UTZ reduced fat kettle chips and 3 Stauffer's Dark Chocolate Stars ~ they are a graham cracker cookie.

I have had IBS in the past so my meals are rather bland.

My Mother has Diabetes and high blood pressure. ~ She is going to be 82 in July.

Unfortunately I do not exercise but I do take the stairs at work which is up three flights or 46 steps.

Let me know your thoughts.
Thank you,
Chris
5/15/2013  My email reply:  

Thank you  for your reply.  Please wish your Mother an early Happy Birthday for me!
And my heart goes out to you, I am familiar with how miserable IBS can make a person.  

 It looks like you are doing some good things in your diet; the reduced fat milk, wheat breads, no alcohol, no smoking, eating grapes, apples, tuna, chicken, --yay for you!!  And taking the stairs- a definite plus! 

 With regard to taking steps to lower your A1c;  decreasing carbohydrate intake is a good way to help do this.  Maybe a couple of times a week, instead of cereal, have  some scrambled  or boiled egg whites with a slice whole grain toast ,  a small piece of fruit, and skim milk.  You will be getting more protein and fiber  which helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol.      
Other suggestions for ways to reduce carbohydrate intake- use reduced sugar jam.  I think the 4C light Pink Lemonade is sugar free- if not, you may want to change to a sugar free version.  And sometime for lunch, have a lean source of protein- maybe a garden salad with grilled chicken breast.  
 And adding more fresh fruits and non starchy  vegetables would be a plus. 

The reduced fat kettle chips are a better choice than regular chips, but still are a source of carbohydrates, as are the graham cracker cookies.  Maybe substitute one or the other out with some sugar free jello, or a piece of fruit or something else that isn?t simple carbohydrates..  This  would cut another chunk of carbohydrates out of your day.  
One of the best ways to reduce both the A1C AND cholesterol and triglycerides is with exercise.  Taking a brisk walk for 20 -30 minutes 3-5 times a week is a good start.  This helps keep blood sugar and cholesterol in check.  
I hope this information is helpful.    If you were to select a health goal for yourself for the upcoming year, what would it be?

Tried to talk with him but his phone just cuts in and out - states only has a cell phone and sometimes it works/sometimes it doesn't.  Will try to call back.
"He is doing ok.  The pain in his leg seems to be some better.  Not gone but better and that is something to be thankful for.  This has allowed him to do a few more things around the house/yard.  This is normally for a limited amount of time but it is much better than just sitting :-) 

The short-term memory issues are what they are but if we can just get him feeling physically better, that would be a big plus. 

Thanks for asking and hope you have a good day

According to the American Diabetes Association guidelines, your fasting blood sugar and HgA1c are both within acceptable ranges  for a diagnosed diabetic.  Congratulations!  
Your blood pressure is a bit above the recommended level of 120/80 or less.  Sometimes at a screening, a members blood pressure can be a bit elevated, for any number of reasons (you may have had to run up the stairs to get to the screening, may have been a particularly stressful day, anxious about the blood draw, etc.).  
CONGRATULATIONS!  Your total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL are all within the desired range.  
Your triglycerides are elevated.  
Your BMI is above the desired range.  
There are some things you can do to reduce your triglycerides and blood pressure.  

With regard to diet-- fiber is not absorbed by the body.  It absorbs cholesterol and fat and takes them away.  So when eating carbohydrates, switch to whole grain products, instead of white rice/bread/pasta/potatoes.
  
Reducing saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol in your diet can improve triglyceride levels as well as help manage cholesterol.
  
Alcohol consumption has strong effects on triglyceride levels.  Drinking more than one drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men can raise triglyceride levels  considerably. 
 
Eat more fish that are high  in omega-3 fa tty acids instead of red meat, which is  high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega-3 fatty acids.  

EXERCISE:  Even ten minutes, three times a day will help with reducing triglycerides and cholesterol.

Having said all that, I have some questions for you: 
1.	Do you have a regular physician?
2.	Have you seen him/her yet?
3.	Did your physician recommend any changes to lifestyle, medications, diet?  Did he/she repeat any labwork?
4.	Do you have a regular exercise routine?
5.	Have you by chance, had your blood pressure rechecked since the screening? If so, what was the reading?
6.	Are you having yearly diabetic eye exams?  Are you doing regular foot checks with your physician? Is your physician monitoring your kidney function yearly?
I look forward to your response!  I am attaching some information you may find helpful.

6/16/2013  Member emailed the following on 6/10/13:

1. Well I quit smoking 6/1/12 - That's over 1 full year now!  I was never a huge smoker.
I probably smoked 1 pack a day at the most.  Mainly I'd smoke about 3 to 4 packs a week.
When I quit I put on about 35 to 45 pounds.  Latest reason is my wife treats me too well!  lol

I've known I've been a pre-diabetic since 2009.  Then I lost all the weight but then when I
quit the smoking, I put on weight then had an episode in December 2012 whereas I was
hospitalized with sugar of 597.  Now I'm supposedly gone too far and must take meds...

Biking - we just went out this weekend again but she hurt her ankle.
My email reply, encrypted:
Good morning!
First I want to say AWESOME JOB ON QUITTING SMOKING!!  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!  You have done your body a huge  favor!  
I?m glad you are moving toward increasing your exercise, I hope your wife?s ankle is healing nicely.  
Wow- you had quite an experience in December-  a blood sugar of 597 certainly doesn?t lend itself to feeling well.
   Are you checking your blood sugars regularly at home?  Is your doctor monitoring your a1c regularly?  It was 7.5 at the screening, which means your blood sugar has averaged 190 for the past couple months.  
It is important to have yearly diabetic eye exams, as well as regular foot checks.  
Have you been seen by a nutritionist to help with diet planning?  Are you comfortable with your knowledge of sources of carbohydrates, and how to plan meals accordingly?    I know this is a lot of questions.  It may be easier to talk on the phone, if you would like- my number here is 877-503-0388.  I will be in the office today and tomorrow 8:30am-4:30pm, then I will be out screening the rest of the week.  I would love to talk with you if you get a chance to call.  
Thank you for replying, hope you are having a great day!

6/16/2013  Member called, he was  diagnosed with diabetes in December 2012, when he was taken to the hospital from work, with a blood sugar of 597.  He is doing much better now.  He is taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He doesn?t check his bs daily- only about once a month, and states it averages 140- he doesn?t check it first thing in the morning.  
He has changed physicians, has a follow up appt in July to recheck his bs and a1c. He said he can?t believe his body is ?failing? him.  Encouraged him to take one day at a time, his wife keeps a watch on his diet, she packs his lunches and cooks diabetic appropriate meals, this helps him stay on track.  He is aware of the need for exercise, but with his work load and schedule he is finding it quite a challenge to exercise.  We discussed ways to creatively add in exercise- maybe whenever he goes to the bathroom, he could do some marching in place/brisk walking the long way to the restroom/walking up and down the stairs at work, etc, walk with a coworker daily.  
He quit smoking a year ago, and states he feels much better- doesn?t get winded so easily, doesn?t have the smokers cough.  Congratulated him on this, reminded him that his body is thanking him!
Encouraged him to check his bs daily, and take these readings to his md when he goes for checkup, as this helps the md with his evaluation of how well the diabetes is managed.  He verbalized understanding of how this is helpful and is willing to check his bs more frequently.  
Reminded him that he can call me with questions if he needs assistance.  ---Mailed member the booklet-

Called to follow up on members diet changes, exercise, and wt loss.  Did she see her MD yet with KYN packet?
"I will be on vacation next week but maybe toward the end of the following week would be good.  I managed to lose 4 pounds during our 12 week Wellness Challenge and I have taken away several good habits that I have incorporated into my daily being.

We are now walking 200 miles to Ocean City MD.  That challenge began on the 8th and will run until Labor Day.  Hopefully I will be able to drop a few more pounds as a result of walking.  I am shooting for 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day.  So far, so good!  I purchased a fitbit zip to keep track of my steps, miles and calories and have already gotten ?3 awards?  - 5,000 steps in one day, 10,000 steps in one day and just today I received one for 50 miles in two weeks.  YAHOO!!!

I still need to find my old paperwork with my numbers to send to you so that you can compare with the new numbers for this year and have bloodwork scheduled for the end of this month.  I need to ask the doctor to add those extra Thyroid tests to my script and will definitely keep you posted as to the results of these tests.

Hope you have a great weekend!
"
"YAYYYYY!!  I?m SO proud of you!!  You are ROCKING fitness ?  Enjoy your vacation!  I?ll check back with you toward the end of the next week.  
Keep up the great work!

"Hey Mr. Edlmayr,

My name is Aileen and I am a RN with Doctors Direct Healthcare. I know you  have already spoke with Karen from Doctors Direct but I wanted to follow up with you to see if you had rechecked your blood pressure (BP), since the Know Your Numbers screening.  It looks like from her note that you have been on a much needed  vacation, which was probably good for you BP and your personal well being.  Hope you had a relaxing vacation.  It sounds like you put a lot of time in at the office.

I would like for you to recheck your BP and call or email me the results.  

Maybe the day  we were at your office you were just stressed about something and it was abnormally high then we would know if you recheck it.  Your BP was so high the day we recorded it that it really concerns me.  Even if  your BP  is that high only when you are a work and you work as many hours as you say, then you have a BP problem.  High BP coupled with stress  and smoking is a lethal combination.   I know your young, and would probably like to just ignore the high reading  but high BP at your young age is concerning.  

You may think you feel fine but BP will slowly wear on your heart, blood vessels and kidneys to the point where you don?t even notice the changes. Eventually it will catch up with you and you will not only have to deal with your BP but additional medical problems created from years of wear and tear.  

Please consider having your pressure checked at your primary care physicians office or at a pharmacy near your work or home and email or call me back with the results.

Thank you for participating in the Know Your Numbers health screening.  I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. 
Below is my contact information.

Member has family hx of heart disease.  2011 had 2 stents place within one month of each other.  Takes LIptor for Hyperlipidemia.  Commended member for taking meds bc they are working. T Chol 131.  States he takes a BP pill for cholesterol, Nipril not for BP.  BP elevated 150/94 day of screening.  States his pressure has been creeping up the last few doctor appts.   
Asked about exercise program.  Member states he does not exercise. That he was probably in the best shape in the last 10yrs when he was in Cardiac rehab in 2011 bc he was exercising 3 x a week.  States he has just committed to &amp;quot;Coach Potato to 5K&amp;quot; program with extended family members. Committed to run/walk a 5K Thanksgiving morning 2013.   Not enthusiastic about it.  States that he will continue bc he has made a commitment to family.  Explained that this 3 x a wk exercise would greatly improve his BS, BP and Cardiac Health.  States that is what his doctor has told him. Encouraged him to continue and try to get more excited about it.  Doctor wants his wt to be 190 which would be a 9 lb loss for member.  GOAL to exercise by walking 3 x a week in park to prepare for 5K.  Member agreed.  "
"Called member to review results of biometric screening.  His results are as follows:  total chol 266, no available data on HDL, LDL;  triglycerides 650, glucose 165, bp 130.87, pulse 86, height 5'6&amp;quot;, wt 181.  Member states MD did an A!c, it was 6.7.  His MD talked with him about the results, recommended that he cut carbohydrates in his diet and increase his exercise. He has started simvastatin for cholesterol and seems to be tolerating is well so far.  He has a blood glucose monitor at home to check his bs twice daily.  He has been doing this, and just yesterday got the first reading that has been below 100 since he started  checking it.  Commended him on this--this is the proof that the changes he is making are working.  
  He thinks his grandfather had diabetes.  
He has made several changes in his diet- cutting out rice, eating more lean protein, no sodas or sweet tea.  He is working out daily on the elliptical (has just today reached the 1 mile mark- congratulated him on this!) and also lifts weights.  Encouraged him to continue to exercise more as his stamina grows.  
He doesn't recall experiencing excessive thirst or urination, fatigue or weight changes but he had been having night sweats.  
He goes to see his MD again for f/u on July 29- will f/u with him after that visit.
We discussed the value of eating a balanced diet- including a lean source of protein, vegetable/fruit/whole grains at each meal.  He had been eating only once a day, and eating a large meal at that time.  He is now working toward making sure he eats at least three times daily.  
He is willing to do what he must to preserve his health. Is interested in seeing a nutritionist-he will ask his MD about this.  "

She works out three times weekly with a trainer.  She is excited about reaching toward her first weight loss goal of 20 pounds.  Congratulated her on the progress she has made.  Encouraged her to keep up the great work!  Will follow up with her in two months."
Met over the phone to go over blood work.  She is on blood pressure medication and sees her doctor annually.  It is something they keep a close eye on.

went over her labs. the member reports she is fine. she feels fine, had blood work done a few years ago and her blood work was fine. she hasn't seen a doctor in a few years. the member voices concern over whether its valid results. strongly encouraged her to go to an urgent care tomorrow since she doesnt see a doctor right now. really encouraged her to see a doctor at urgent care, take her labs with her and if she doesnt trust the labs, let them redraw her blood and get new numbers.  i explained the relationship between a1c and fasting blood sugars and the a1c. then we discussed the number we want diabetics to be at for control, the a1c guidelines the ADA sets and how high her numbers are. 
the member agrees to see an urgent care provider and get a pcp relationship set up. she is ok with me calling her back in two weeks for follow up. but i am not sure she is really able to appreciate this set of numbers until she gets another set from a lab to show they really are valid. "

"Good morning.  I spoke with Kim Bullard, another nurse here in my office.  Kim and you have spoken before about your HgbA1c and she has done some health coaching with you  regarding your HgbA1c and blood sugar levels earlier this year and in 2012.  Since Kim has worked with you before, she is your health coach for the  MAG mutual group so I am going to let her know I have touched base with you again. Kim and I do work together on this group and we at DDHC will help you with education and encouragement to get that HgbA1c and your risk for diabetes lowered.  
Please do not let yourself get discouraged. It takes persistence and patience to improve on those numbers and you did decrease the HgbA1c from 6.6 to 6.4 over the past year.  So that is awesome!
I am copying Kim on this email.  
Please let Kim know how she can help you best.
Have a great day.

I have measured my blood pressure again. It was still somewhat high. 139/91
I am checking the blood pressure carefully the next few weeks and try to get it down by my own. 
If it doesn?t work then I will have to see a doctor again.

"Member called to review biometric screening results.  She was diagnosed with diabetes at the beginning of this year.  She is currently on 1000 mg of metformin daily. 
Her a1c was 7.2, is now down to 5.1 
 She stated her problem is her weight, lack of exercise, and eating late at night.  She knows what she needs to do but just hasnt' done it.  She works a lot of hours and by the time she gets home she is too tired to think about exercising.  She is considering purchasing a treadmill so she can walk for a sustained period of time (ten minutes, twenty minutes, then thirty ) to get the benefit of cardio exercise.  Encouraged her to do so.  Discussed creative ways to increase her activity level (take stairs instead of elevator at work, walk during lunch break, park farther away from stores so she has to walk more).
She has quit smoking in the past and feels if she were able to to this, she certainly can meet her GOAL of increasing exercise and losing weight.  She has seen a four pound weight loss since beginning the metformin.  Congratulated her on this.  She reports she is doing better with her diet, not eating foods that are high in sugar.  Discussed changing from white to whole grain breads/ rice/pasta, she is already doing this. 
She reports she has changed her late evening menu to include more fruits/veges instead of processed foods.  
Congratulated her on the progress she has made thus far.  Encouraged to really push to exercise, even just a little each day to begin with.  She verbalized understanding that exercise is key to regulating blood sugars and a1c.  "
08/01/13 Call to Tom at the req of HESCO HR. New grp effective 08/01. Tom has procedure sched 08/06 TEE.  Anthem had approved.  Concerned as phys is out of network with CIGNA. Facility is in network.  Wanted to know if needed to postpone.  States are doing procedure to r/o aneurysm.  Brother died of a dissecting thoracic aneurysm and he has had some irreg heart beats.  Exp did not want him to postpone.  Facility & any ancillary phys who would be performing or interpretating would be most of the charges & are in network.  Might possibly have f/u appt with FP (OON) to discuss with results.  But will not penalize for that visit.  Might consider changing FP in future or could continue as OON if he wishes.  Appreciative of the call.
"Member called in response to my letter.  She confirmed that her phone number is 909-596-4879, she doesn't know why it went to a fax when I tried to call.  At any rate, thanked member for calling to review her results.  She has seen her MD and he recommended that she change her diet, and increase exercise.  She has been following a mediteranean diet (plenty of fruit and vegetables).  She has had labs repeated since the screening was done, her tchol came down from 245 to 231, her ldl is down from 167 to 148. 
Because of an injury to her right foot, she has not exercised as much as she would like.  She recently moved and is still trying to get settled in.  Suggested water aerobics as a low impact exercise, she will check into this.  Congratulated her on reducing her lipids, encouraged her to continue with her diet and work on her goal of increasing exercise.  Discussed creative ways to exercise (taking stairs instead of elevator, parking farther away from shopping centers, etc.).  She will be returning to MD for lab f/u in a few weeks.  "
Talked with member,  he verified his name and DOB;  he gives his permission to discuss his health care with his wife, as he is recovering from chemotherapy /CA treatment.  
Mrs. Miller called to review biometric screening results of Mr. Miller, her husband.  He gave permission to me on the phone to discuss his results with his wife after her verified his name, DOB.  Member is recovering from testicular cancer and chemotherapy.  Discussed the a1c and fbs-per Mrs. Miller  these were both elevated as a result of the chemotherapy medications.  Member eats heart healthy, does gardening, walks and does yoga on a regular basis.  He drinks lots of water, doesn't take any pain medications.  His weight had dropped to 120 pounds at one time, he is back up to 160 lbs now.  
Member had returned my call and left a message, I called him back.   He reports he has been diabetic for about two years.  He was over 300 pounds but had lap band surgery, and  has lost down to 235 now.  He takes Valsartan for his bp.  He sees his MD nearly every month for diabetes and hypertension monitoring.  His grandparents were diabetic, and took insulin.  He doesn't want to reach the point  of having to take insulin so he takes good care of himself.  After receiving the diabetes diagnosis he changed his eating habits to include less fried and fatty foods, and more fruit/vegetables, with smaller portions.  He has regular foot checks and diabetic eye exams.  He is disabled due to back issues.  He does walk as much as possible for exercise.  Encouraged him to continue with his healthy diet and exercise as much as possible.  He does monitor his bs daily at home.

Also, just an update.  When I saw my doctor in June my A1c test was 5.6.
Yeah!!!!!.  Doctor was happy with that.  Like is still hectic for me but does seem to be slowing down a bit.  I'm trying to do a better job with my meal planning as it had gotten off track.  Boy, it takes work to plan your meals and stick to a healthy eating plan but I know I really must push myself to do that not only for myself but for my husband as well.  If you recall, I had told you he is battling Congestive Heart Failure and diet is one of the things the people at Cardiac Rehab really stressed to him.

Look forward to hearing from you.

"Hi ______
 Thank you for the update and for the quiz.  I now have you as being compliant with 2 classes for this year. 
I am so proud of you for the HbgA1c of 5.6.  That is awesome and you have worked hard for that result!  Way to go!
You are correct about meal planning being challenging....but it does pay off.  Once you realize how an unhealthy diet can harm your health, it does help though.  
At one time, your husband was wearing a lifevest.  Is he still wearing that. Is his CHF better controlled now with diet and medications?  I hope he is doing OK.

Thanks.  My husband had a permanent debribulator installed so he is no longer wearing the life vest.  His CHF is better controlled now but it is quite a challenge adjusting to life styles changes.
"Good Morning Lori. I'm trying to find a healthy dry cereal and reading the labels just gets me more confused. At the present time I mix Special K (fruit &amp;amp; yogurt) Great  Grains ( raisins ,dates, &amp;amp; pecans). Do you publish a list of healthy cereals or can you suggest options? Thanks, 

"
"Thanks for your email about healthy cereals.
I have attached 3 articles on how to choose a healthy cereal and what to look for when reading labels.
It is good to start off your day with high protein and fiber  to keep you full longer and not so much sugar.  Cereal is a carbohydrate so the less sugar content the better. Avoid high fructose corn syrup in all of your foods when possible.  
The cereals that have WHOLE grains and less sugar are the best. The whole grain is not as refined or processed.  The grams of whole gains on the labels should be close to the serving size listed on the label meaning that the cereal is closer to 100% whole grain. 
 Try to use skim milk rather than whole milk.
Lower fat choices usually have higher sugar content and low sugar choices usually have higher fat content.  

--Raisin Bran Extra with fruit and almonds is a good choice.  

--Post Bran Flakes, 130 calories, 5 g of fiber, 1.5 tsp sugar per cup. You can add fresh fruit as you like.  

-- Kashi GOLEAN, 140 calories, 10 g of fiber (includes isolated fiber), 1.5 tsp sugar per cup. They have Toasted Berry Crumble and Summer Berry Granola also. 

-- General Mills Fiber One 80 Calories, 110 calories, 10 g of fiber (includes isolated fiber), 1 tsp sugar per cup

-- Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites, 190 calories, 6 g of fiber, 3 tsp sugar per cup

-- Whole Foods 365 Organic Raisin Bran, 180 calories, 6 g of fiber, 4 tsp sugar per cup

--Also remember that oatmeal with granola,  fruit and / or nuts added on top is an excellent choice as a hot cereal.  

Please read the attached articles as they list other options and give great explanations.

"Member called, stated she is having a very difficult time.  She continues to experiencing frequent low grade temp with malaise.  She doesn't know when an 'episode' is going to come on, or how long it will last, but when it starts, she is unable to do much of anything.  She has been seen by an infectious disease specialist, who has ruled out any infectious disease process. She feels she is having a recurrence of the non-hodgkins lymphoma but the tumor hasn't appeared yet, and states her MD feels the same way.   The plan  is to wait until a tumor appears then it can be treated- until then the fever is basically a 'fever of unknown origin' with malaise.  She is concerned about her job, her family having to take care of her, her financial situation- so much is in the air right now, with her having more frequent bouts of the fever and malaise episodes.  She continues to work 12 hour shifts.  
She feels she is letting her sons down (ages 21, 15, and 8) because she spends so much time in bed.  Encouraged her to do what she can, and rest when she needs to. She can only do what she can do- and to take life one day at the time.  Acknowledged that she is in  a stressful situation.  Encouraged her to take one day at the time, enjoy the times when she feels good, let her family take care of her when she needs them to, and to discuss her situation and concerns with her MD.  She has appt in September, will call me after that appt."
Talked with member on phone, reviewed KYN results.  fbs 109, a1c 6.2, tchol 201, tri 143, hdl 44, ldl 128, bp 123/78.  Member states she takes bp medication.  Saw her MD recently and MD also talked with her about the elevated a1c, gave her some guidelines to follow to help reduce it.  I discussed with member the ADA guidelines that place an a1c of 6.2 in the moderate risk category to develop diabetes.  She has aunts and grandmother that are diabetic. She has cut down on sugary sodas and tea, and is eating more fruits/vegetables.  She has been eating yogurt and a banana for breakfast- encouraged her to eat berries instead of bananas.  Discussed changing from white bread/rice/pasta to whole grains.  Also to eat less processed foods and not eat out.  Stressed the importance of exercise in reducing the A1c/blood sugars- she has been walking for exercise, but only 1-2 times per week.  Encouraged her to increase this up to 3-5 times per week consistently.  She has f/u appt with MD on August 15, agreed to call me with her lab results of that visit.  We discussed the diagnostic criteria of the ADA --an a1c of 6.5= diabetic, and that once you have diabetes it doesn't go away, and the possible complications of diabetes.  Will f/u with her after her MD visit.
Labs faxed to MD listed on screening form.
Everything is fine. Still struggling with weight loss and still exercising.   
"The email was for both of you  as general educational information.  
I have your primary address as dlowry@atlanticcasualty.net and Rand?s address as tigeskier4@msn.com. 
Glad you are doing well.  But sorry you are having difficulty with the weight loss.  Sometimes, we need to change our activity to surprise our body, in case we have gotten used to a certain exercise routine.  Keep up the exercise and try to change it to various activities.  For example, if you can do both aerobic type activity and strength training , for example  light weights-that may help your metabolism kick up a notch  to make the weight come off better.  
Try walking, swimming, biking (alternating )  3 times per week and then using light weights or some type of yoga or pilates or floor exercises 2-3 times per week.  
This may help along with your dieting.   
Enjoy the rest of the summer.  Lori

Did not leave message. Not sure I have the correct ph#. Member's hand writing indecisive. Voice mail stated it was &amp;quot;Scotty&amp;quot;. Will email member for correct ph# and communication for KYN f/u.  
"Hey ........,
This is Kim from Doctors Direct Healthcare. We did your KYN health screening at Randolph EMC last month. I would like to discuss your KYN results.
I?ve tried to reach you by phone, but have been unsuccessful. I?m having a hard time reading your hand writing to decipher the #s &amp;amp; am not sure I have the right ph#, so I haven?t left a message. It looks like it is 999-999-9999, but that answering machine stated it was ?Scotty?. Please reply to this email with your correct phone # and the best time to reach you. 
Your BP was up at the screening. Have you been able to recheck your BP (blood pressure)?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Kim
"
Member stated she is working the &amp;quot;drive thru&amp;quot; so she couldn't talk. She did say that she is waiting for a phone call from her doctor regarding additional blood work. She stated she is checking her BS. Member asked if this nurse could email her. She works from 8a-5p and is busy dealing with her mom. 
"Hey ...,
Thanks for taking my call. I totally understand being in a situation/position at work and not being able to talk. Communicating via email is a great alternative. Please keep in mind that we may need to go back and forth a couple of times to complete a conversation.
Taking a look at your KYN results, your A1c was quite high at 10.5. That is an avg BS (blood sugar) of 255 for the past 3 months. 

Here are my questions: 
?	Are you on any special medications which would make your A1c/BS go up, like oral steroids? 
?	Have you contacted your physician in regards to your numbers?
?	How often do you check your BS and what have they been lately?
?	What diet/exercise changes have you made to help get your BS down?
?	What medications are you taking for your BS and your BP?

Don?t mean to overwhelm you with questions. Most of our conversations will be much shorter than the original. It sounds like you are actively addressing your BS already. Please let me know how you are doing. I?ve attached a couple of educational sheets and recipes to assist you with healthy eating and exercise. 

If you are willing to share what?s going on with your mom, I?ll add her to our prayer list. We have pray at our office every Monday. 
Please let me know if there is anything specific which I can do to help you. 
Warm Regards,
"
"......
Thanks for calling with me. No need to answer the questions in the 1st email, since we talked on the phone. 
I?m excited that you are making changes to your diet and exercise to gain control of your BS (blood sugar) and progress in your journey to a healthier lifestyle. YAY!

These are the goals we discussed:
?	Get A1c and BS down to WNL (within normal limits)
?	Learn to manage BS on a daily basis
Your action plans (how to obtain your goal):
?	Measure potatoes (or whatever starches you have at meals) so you only receive one serving (most of the time its � cup)
?	Reduce if not totally stop drinking sweet tea ? try Splenda or Stevia
?	Drink more water (add lemon, lime or make a pitcher of cucumber water by washing, peeling, slicing a cucumber and placing in a pitcher of water)
?	Schedule an appt with your physician for a ?Physical Exam? 
?	Continue taking medications &amp;amp; checking BS

Thanks so much for taking time to call me. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
Please take care of yourself. You are WORTH it!!

Please let me know when your MD appt is. I look forward to hearing from you.
Warm Regards,
Kim

"Hey Kim,

I'm still working on my portion sizes. Over the past couple of months I have been dealing with a lot of knee and feet pain. During this time I have been seeing an orthopedic and they are still trying to find the source of the issues. I am scheduled for an MRI on July 1st. they have been giving me a series of shots to help with the pain. I have been continuing to walk and swim as much as possible.

Thanks,

"Hey Kim,

Sorry we didn't call this weekend. We have been very busy with birthday parties and getting ready for VBS at church which started last night and will go until Wednesday. Hopefully after that we will have some time to breathe. :)

Also, I checked my blood pressure this morning and it was 114/79. I was very surprised but I can tell my exercise and diet is working. Is that too low now?
"
"YAY!! That's a GREAT BP! No, not too low. That's what we call &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;!     ;o)

Friday evening will probably be the best day to call, but call me any day, anytime. I'll be off work Thursday - Sunday. I look forward to your call. So try to call during those days.

Since we talked last Tuesday, I have received great news! Check this out!!! 

Here is my testimony (please share with anyone you like):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I?ve been on a journey for the last 4 years to a healthier lifestyle. Those of you who are aware, know how HARD I?ve worked for these past 4 years. God has amazingly set me up with the best job/company/friends &amp;amp; all the tools to succeed! 

I?ve been eating very healthy, mostly all natural/organic foods; exercising 4-7 times/week; drinking water mostly, with the exception of some nonfat milk &amp;amp; 1 cup of coffee/day; limiting my saturated fat intake &amp;amp; avoiding all trans fats; trying new foods; learning to listen to the Holy Spirit; switching from ?white? to ?brown? carbs; eating fresh fruits every day; switching to Stevia; reading labels; checking restaurant nutritional info b4 going; measuring &amp;amp; tracking food; purchasing equipment to enable me to exercise; etc. All these things, along with encouraging trainers, coworkers &amp;amp; friends spurring me on, enabled me to reach all of my goals except one. 

Tho I reached my goal of wt, size and muscle tone, I had one last goal, which was unreached?the issue of my CHOLESTEROL! As I said, I?ve been working on this for 4 years. I?m a RN. I know what to do to be healthy. I tried fish oil, red yeast rice, chai seeds, garlic, flax seed and other recommendations. My job is being a health coach. I do this every day, but my chol just wasn?t coming down. All the things (above) together and still my chol was 236 in 2009, 212 in 2010, 243 in 2011, (I don?t have 2012 # handy), &amp;amp; just this April 2013, it was 250! THEN I became a distributor for &amp;quot;It Works!&amp;quot; and started taking one of our products called ?FAT FIGHTERS? for JUST 2 months. I received a phone call from my MD office last week &amp;amp; my chol. is 182!!! 
IT WORKS!!!! I can?t describe in words how off-the-chain excited I am! Even the nurse who called me with my results wants to buy some Fat Fighters now. God has been GOOD to me!

Many folks have difficulty taking the chol medications (?statins?) due to leg cramps &amp;amp; other side effects. Fat Fighters bind with up to 19 grams of fat (when you take them 15-60 minutes after a meal) &amp;amp; inhibit carb uptake, help to balance blood sugar, help you not to feel bloated/yucky/sluggish after a high fat/carb cheat meal, etc.  All of our products are all natural so they really work. BTW?my triglycerides were 57! Normal is &amp;lt;150. My HDL is 77! Normal is &amp;gt;39. My LDL was 94. Normal is &amp;lt;130. Do you know someone who wants to lose wt, be healthier, has cholesterol issues or just wants to prevent themselves from absorbing more fat? Call or email me if interested in ?It Works!? products or becoming a distributor. ?It Works!? wants ALL of their customers healthy &amp;amp; their distributors debt free. There is an explosion of God?s goodness in my life! Who wants to jump in with me? Who will celebrate with me!?!?!?  

To check out the products, shop or the business opportunity, go to my website: kimmiebullard.myitworks.com. Please call me before ordering so I can personally assist you &amp;amp; share helpful deals we have available. Cell ph: (910) 850.5600.

Woohoo!!!!
Now how about that?  Woohooo! I'm soooo excited!
Thanks for listening/reading this.

"How about ThermoFit?

Cost and would it help me?
"
"Yes it helps. I'm taking it now. Lost 2 pounds in the past 2 weeks while not eating too healthy (not like I normally do-cause I've had so many appts at restaurants)...and I've only worked out 2x/week for the past 2 weeks. It has B12 to boost energy &amp;amp; the stuff Dr. Oz talked about (raspberry drops) raspberry ketones, which help with wt loss. 

The cost for Thermofit is 39$ plus tax &amp;amp; shipping (probably around 45$.
"
"So I can take the Fat Fighter and Thermofit together? Or is it kind of either or?

The Fat Fighter is cheaper at $23 vs $39. I just want to make sure what I get works since we just don't have a lot of money to spare right now.
"
"You &amp;quot;could&amp;quot; take both at once, but with $ being tight, if you have to pick between the 2, I'd pick the fat fighter over the thermofit. If you take them during the same month, this is how you would take them. Minutes (5-10) before you eat lunch and dinner, take the thermofit with water, then eat your meal. Wait 50 min after your meal and then take your fat fighter(s). 

If you can afford it, you could do this:
But 2 fat fighters this month (around 60$); use one bottle the 1st month by taking one after lunch and one after dinner (or 2 after a high fat/carb meal when you go to a restaurant or something) for the first month; then the 2nd month change your order from the 2 fat fighters to the Thermofit (around 45-48$), take it before lunch and dinner and only take the fat fighter (from the 2nd bottle) if you are eating a high fat/carb meal. The 2nd bottle of fat fighters should last you a couple of months like that if you are eating real healthy by then. You could even intentionally take one/day and the 2nd bottle would last 2 months. So if you are drinking a protein shake for lunch and eating dinner with your family, you could take the one fat fighter per day at dinner (talking about the 2nd month). 

Does this make sense?
When my &amp;quot;It Works!&amp;quot; pay check reaches an extra $1000.00/month, I'm going to buy you the Profit protein powder &amp;amp; give it to you. It's all natural, so it is absorbed by your body and your body can really use it. In the meantime, you can get a protein powder and make your own shakes with nonfat milk or cold water or with the recipe I gave you.

Hope this helps.
Have you read the info I gave you on the 23rd? 
Remember to keep adding those bullets (on the tip sheet) to your lifestyle.
Go ......!!!

"Hey Kim,

I hope you are doing well. We haven't forgot you. Just been really busy.
When you have to small children there is always something going on. Plus we are trying to figure out how to purchase any of the product at the moment.
We are praying for God's support and that he will make away for us to have the extra funds to purchase some product.

Thanks again and God Bless,
"
"
I will pray in agreement with you.
These are tough times, but God's economy is not the same as our's.
I'm praying He blesses you far beyond what you need to buy products, but to prosper you in every area of lack.
May your vats overflow. May every need be met. May there be an abundance in your household.
"
"One more thing if you would remember.

Please remember .....(spouse)...... and all the teachers/assistant teachers in North Carolina. 2 weeks before Stacie is supposed to go back to work and we still don't know if she will have a job or if she will be placed at a different school. This not only effects Stacie and me but will affects our children as well. We know God has it under control but things are a bit scary at the moment.
"
"Wow. That's cutting it close and I'm betting it makes you both feel pretty vulnerable.

Father,
I bring ....... and ........ before your throne. Your Word says in Is 49:16 that You have written their names in the palm of Your hand; that you have good plans for them to prosper &amp;amp; be in good health according to Jer 29:11; that You arm them with strength &amp;amp; support them according to Ps 18; that You are their light and salvation per Ps 27; that as they wait quietly before You, their victory comes from You, that You alone are their rock &amp;amp; salvation, their fortress where they will never be shaken. Per Ps 62; and that You bend down and listen to their voices, being fully engaged in their lives per Ps 116. Thank You for hearing the pleas of their hearts. Thank You that  though the enemy may try to come against them, You have already conquered him through the blood of Jesus and have given ...... and ....... everything they need to overcome. Thank You that You are their provider, not man and that no weapon formed against them will prosper according to Is 54:17. I proclaim Your Word over them and speak blessings upon them. I ask that you would show off, give them favor with You, favor with man and provision beyond their expectations. I ask that you would give them kingdom eyes, visions and dreams. Enable them to shut down all doubt and unbelief from the enemy or from any &amp;quot;nay sayers&amp;quot;, unwitting instruments of the enemy (people). I plead the blood of Jesus over them and proclaim Him as their savior, rescuer and living hope...their Life. May the Holy Spirit breathe new life in them, comfort and rest. May You enable them to lay back on Your chest &amp;amp; rest in Your arms, KNOWING that you hold ALL things together according to Col 1:17. 
In Jesus Name,
Amen!
"
Thank you so much!! God Bless You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

"Good Morning Kim,

I am maintaining my weight at 150 lbs.  I think it is up a couple of pounds due to my monthly cycle.  I am exercising a couple of days a week for 1 hour with the dance video for abs, back fat, and toning.  I am out of my Crestor medicine because I have to be seen by my doctor.  We have a new health insurance provider that does not permit me to take Crestor without a good doctor reason.  I was given Crestor before at the generic price because of the type of medicine.  I can not get it now even paying the name brand co-pay.  I tried other generic medicines for cholesterol but two kinds made me have an allergic reaction.  I have an appointment in a few weeks to discuss a plan with my doctor.  I hope you have a great day!!
"
"I have a solution to your &amp;quot;Crestor&amp;quot; issue.

I?ve been on a journey for the last 4 years to a healthier lifestyle. ...(sent testimony regarding chol.)

How about that?!?  Isn't that amazing? My chol dropped 68 points in just 2 months!!

I've attached informational sheets to help with food choices to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Let me know if you are interested in the fat fighters. They are 23$ plus tax and shipping. Less than most copays &amp;amp; you don't need a prescription for it. It comes straight to your home.

Good morning.

I am doing well. Still exercising at least 4-5 times a week. Usually for an hour.
Trying to drink more water-- sometimes is challenging but Crystal Light packets help.

Having no other problems/issues.

Hope you are doing great.

"Good Morning, 

I am finally married now! So a lot of stress has already lifted. I will be started the gym on base soon with some of the other spouses. I am very excited about being able to get onto base. I have not made much progress in the weight loss department. Visiting home for almost two weeks set me back... but I didn't gain weight when I went home either. I simply stayed  at my current weight of 206. I really want to break through the 200 mark before the summer ends. It is my personal goal to accomplish that. 

Thanks, 
"
"Good Afternoon, 

I wanted to give you an update on my progress. I just came back to work from my vacation (cruise) on May 29th. I did gain two pounds back on the cruise  ( came back at 210 lbs.) I also came back engaged, and have started an infamous wedding diet. I say I am dieting but actually I am eating how I am supposed to, counting my calories with a great app called myfitnesspal. I started Monday with the counting and started eating healthier the minute I got home. I am already down to 207.2 as of this morning. I am allowed 1,580 calories a day and have to work out 3 times a week so far for 45 minutes.  As for my mental health now, it is about to get pretty stressful, because we are having the wedding at home in Louisiana. That's about it for me, ... I think. 

Thanks, 
"
"Hey ....,
Great to hear from you. You only gained 2 pounds!?! That?s great! 
Awww. Congratulations!!!! When is the big date? 
Wow! You are already back in the game. Great job at jumping back in and eating healthy and exercising. Are you still doing the Zumba classes? 
 
Suggestions for the stressors: plan ahead; obtain an organizational book to help you plan; don?t accept stress or pressure from others and try not to create it for yourself; have your wedding the way you want it; keep it simple; you can only do what you can do; delegate what you can; ask for help; when people say they want to help, write their name and ph# down so that when you have a need, you can call them with it;?and? let the little stuff go. 
Keep me updated on your plans. I?m so excited for you! 
 
Just shoot me an email on the 1st day of every month and let me know: 
?? ? ? ? ?Current wt 
?? ? ? ? ?What exercise you are doing &amp;amp; how often 
?? ? ? ? ?What you are doing with your diet plan 
 
Warm Regards, 
Kim

"Kim, 

I am down to 204 lbs. as of this morning. Lately, the exercise regimen has been working outside on the weekends. We have been building a fence for the past month or so, ** with no nail gun, only a hammer. I am still on the counting calories diet. I love it. Now that I am paying attention to everything that I eat, I am scared at what I used to eat in restaurants. I now think that they use syringes of fats and oils and inject all foods in the restaurant industry. I am still struggling to find the right physical activity for me, but I haven't stopped looking. Also they have increased my  Ritalin to 15 mg a day. I take 10mg in the morning and 5mg before 3 PM. It wasn't lasting throughout the day. Also I am still on the Dicyclomine (Bentyl), for my IBS. The IBS is still a struggle, but I see little improvements every so often.  I have bought a dress for the wedding, and it is a size smaller than when I started trying on dresses, I went from a 16 to a 14 in dresses. (Only in dresses), But I am happy about it. We also have a location for the reception and ceremony. I have gotten a photographer, and I took your advice and my aunt offered to pay for the flowers for the reception. I have let her take full reign with that. Right now we are working on our guest list so that we can plan on the food and beverage needed for the reception. I am trying to keep the stress down with organization, I am using TheKnot app/website. They have a budgeter and well thought out To-Do list. It helps out soo much. 

Thank You, 
"
"Yay! Great report. Sounds like you have made much progress. I?m so excited for you! 
When is the big date? 
Remember to take care of yourself. You are worth it!  ;o) 
Keep adding those ?tips?. 
  
Shoot me another update in Sept between the 1st and 10th. 
Hugs, 
Kim 
PS. I?ll be there at SIG n Aug. 21st.  Come see me and tell me who you are (name, you went on cruise and got engaged). 
"
"Our big date is .... ..., 2013. 

Yes right now I am trying to balance the stress and trying to have fun while planning. 

I have you marked in the calendar for Sept 4th to shoot you an email. Looking forward to seeing you on August 21st. 
"
Congrats. It?s great that you have several months to plan and prepare.  ;o)
Member called to review her results, make sure we had received her fax. Reviewed her results.  Her GOAL for the upcoming year is to start exercising.  She has found this to be a challenge with her 3 year old child.  Discussed creative ways to exercise- parking far out in the parking lot when shopping so she has to walk more; taking stairs at work; doing sit ups or jumping jacks during commercial breaks on TV, walking in the park with her daughter in her stroller.  She is amenable to trying these ideas.  
"YAY!! Congrats!!!
That?s incredible that you didn?t gain any wt after visiting home for 2 weeks!
Great goal to break the 200 mark. You can do it. Get out the ?tips? sheet I sent you. Add one bullet to your lifestyle every week or every month, however fast/slow you want to do this. 
You are WORTH IT!!!

"Hi Kim,
I am doing well. I was bike riding, swimming and using the elliptical, so exercising 4-5 times a week at least. Right now I have tendinitis in my foot that had surgery and am back in an air cast with PT starting in a couple weeks as I am still not walking correctly since it was deformed such a long time. I will keep swimming and biking in the meantime.

My weight is down to 159 so I am finally making progress with that. We are getting CSA produce deliveries weekly and are eating much more veggies and a more diverse group of veggies and less of everything else! It has been fun to see what will be in the box each week!

Had to double my prednisone as I am flaring (had reduced from 15 mg to 5 mg which is the lowest I have been in years) and will need another Rituxan infusion asap which will set me back about 6 weeks but I think overall we are making progress with my health and I am pleased with that. I should be able to reduce prednisone after my infusion.

Hope you are having a good summer.

for me - well, I'm still an absolute mess;  I'm not doing anything at all to stop this roller coaster I'm on.  My intention is every day - to try to &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; changing something.  My job here - - well, I really do think that if they keep me around the rest of this year, it'll be a miracle, and it will be only because they're trying to set things in motion;  I don't see myself being here much (if any at all) - after the first of the year.  Since they monitor emails, I'd prefer to basically nix any further talk on my end about this - for obvious reasons.  All I know to do - is to keep doing my job like always - with speed and efficiency - and try to accept whatever's going to happen.  It ties my  mind up terribly, and sabotages everything else I do.  I'm struggling with weight gain, depression, and basically wondering how did it come down to this after 25 years of employment?  I just don't know what I did to &amp;quot;fall from grace&amp;quot; - other than getting old.  So, my mind is tied up all the time, with wondering if every day, they're going to come to my desk, pull me in a room, and ask me to collect my things;  So many things - just point in that direction - - how I'm treated, how I'm left out of things that I used to be included in, just the general &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; of it all.  The only reason I'm telling you any of this - is so you can see where my head is;  I think back to how I had it so &amp;quot;together&amp;quot; six months ago - and how I've gone just down hill ever since then.  Things with my extended family (brothers, my parents' house, etc) - well, they're kind of stagnate now - -  which is ok - except my niece has now moved into my parents home, which is a LONG story in the making, one which involves her now wanting to have Thanksgiving and Christmas in what she now considers &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; home;  She is a TENANT, and it was and always will be &amp;quot;my&amp;quot; home - - the only one I ever knew growing up.  My brothers, either never lived there at all, or just a few years;  They say they realize it's &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; for me, but no one really &amp;quot;gets&amp;quot; it - or they wouldn't be asking me to spend the two holidays where I miss my parents the most - in a house where I spent every holiday in - until their death a few years ago - -   OK - so that's enough of that;  I will probably just stand up to them - tell them I'm not going - and for them to have it without me;  If I force the hand and have them have it somewhere else, then it makes &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; look like a jerk - for not being able to just &amp;quot;get over it&amp;quot;.  For that reason, I'll probably just bow out  of it all.  There's so much baggage there, I can't even begin.   

every day - I try to accept where I am, where I need to be - I'm not motivated to change - and I honestly don't know where to even start. 
I'm just lost all the way around. 
"
Kim, wanted to be sure you got this - I was having computer issues about the time this went through. 
"
I did receive it. 
I?m sorry for your struggles. 
I?m unable to respond at this time, but would love to meet with you one-on-one when I come for the class in July. 
Would that be possible? I?ll even stay after work if I need to, so we can meet. 
The date is July 23rd. I?ll be available around 130-230pm. 
Will that work for you?

I continue to walk/jog &amp;amp; trying to take advantage of all the fresh fruits &amp;amp; vegetables available now.  Also trying to monitor intake of soft drinks
"
"Thanks .....
Did you make an appt with your MD to recheck your A1c?
"
"Sounds great ....
Here are some suggestions for reducing your intake of sodas:
?	Add a slice of lemon or lime to your SIG cup filled with ice water
?	Make a pitcher of cucumber water for a change of flavor
?	Check out pinterest or sparkpeople  or google for combinations of fruit/veg to add to water for flavor

Sometimes we feel restricted when trying to break a habit of something like sodas. 
So fresh fruit in our water can help us to feel like we are being treated to something special instead of being restricted. 
It may be a play on the mind, but whatever I can get to work, I will utilize.  ;o)

Hope this is helpful.

Thanks,

"Hi. Finally I have achieved some weight loss.  180. More to go. Very excited and motivated. Cut way back on carbs after discussing blood tests and glycemic index with dr. Triglycerides were a little high. Otherwise blood tests good. I cut out slimfasts, bananas, most gluten and for now even oatmeal and whole wheat. Trying to eat more protein, egg whites, some meat though it is not my favorite. Watching carbs in veggies, fruits. 

Need to swim... have not made time but will. Getting ready for a change in meds per cardiologist today. Stopping lisinopril and lasix. He is prescribing something different to slow my heart rate down, after reviewing some recent tests. Heart and mechanical valve in good shape, he said. Praise God!
"
As discussed today, attached is the June compliance memo. I sent it June 20.  I have frequent INR tests and constant contact with physician or nurses. Doing the best I can. 
"Got it. Thanks .......
...And thanks for the grace. My apologies that I've been out of the office so much lately.
Kim
"
"Yay ...........!
Congrats on the wt loss!
Good job cutting way back on carbs. That's really key. 
When eating fruit, chose the high fiber and low glycemic index fruits.
I've attached 2 sheets for you to print so you can compare the fruits high in fiber and low in glycemic index.
Good plans on swimming. The more often you do it the better. You burn LOTS of calories swimming. It's almost like cheating.  ;o) Some good choices for protein: chicken, fish, turkey, soy, edamames (green soy beans), tofu, walnuts, almonds, some legumes in moderation (because they also have carbs).
What did your cardiologist change your medicine to? (You were going to stop Lasix and Lisinopril.) Glad your valve is doing well. 
Let me know if there is more I can do for you.
Hope to see you at the KYN screening on Sept 24th.
Warm Regards,
"

"Good to hear from you ....... Thanks for sending me an update. You have an amazing HDL! That?s off the chain. Are you eating lots of nuts or fish or both? 
Have you cut down on the saturated fats (red meat/pizza/fast foods/ice cream)? Keep in mind that if you don?t want to do without icecream, for instance, you can just choose a better type of ice cream. There are low fat ice creams that are still very tasty. Watch the serving size. What changes have you made? Answer the questions above, then shoot me another update by the end of Aug. If there is anything I can do to help you further, let me know. Remember to read your nutritional labels. That will help you make choices. 
Warm Regards, 
Kim

"Kim, 

I eat fish three times a week, pasta once and week and pizza on Fridays but I'm trying to cut down on the pizza. I also eat low fat ice cream and I'm trying to cut down on the serving sizes (summer time is difficult).  I haven't made any changes in my workout routine but continue to watch what I eat. 
  
Thank You,

Member returned my call.  She does not have a family history of diabetes.  She does report eating a lot of rich foods over the past few months.  Discussed her fbs of 103, and A1c of 5.8, which is in the ADA moderate risk category.  Discussed ways to change her diet and add exercise to help reduce her bs and A1c.  She has rechecked her bp since the screening, when it was 170/98, it was down to 147/89, 139/86.  These numbers are better than the 170/98 but still elevated, advised that she keep a written record of her bps and follow up with her MD on both her bs/a1c AND elevated bp and cholesterol.  Discussed ways to reduce cholesterol.  Member will contact her MD and let me know when she has seen him/her. 
"(from wife) Not sure how much he smokes per day - but I will say that he has started smoking those electronic cigarettes half of the time - so ever how much he smokes - he's about cut that in half now.  I'm to the point with his smoking that I leave the area where he is until the cigarette is out - it bothers me that bad.  My attitude is - yeah, people have every right to smoke it - just as much as I have every right not to smell it.   
If nothing else, I'll make a note to send you a status update in August.

Hey Kim, Since we did not really have any goals for me and I was just to maintain what I was doing, all is well and nothing has changed. Continuing to eat healthy, drink water and exercise daily. All my yearly physicals were done when I spoke to you last. I hope you are well and enjoying your summer!
"Great to hear from you. .... said you both are still exercising and doing well. That is great to hear.

You are still eating healthy and drinking adequate amounts of water (avoiding sugar drinks)?
That?s all I need to know.

Yes, still eating healthy. Not big on red meat so no change there! I eat A LOT of Greek yogurt for brkfast  and salads for lunch. With running and working out in the summertime, I always drink water! If we have juice, we always do half water half juice because Rob does not like it sweet. :)
As stated in previous response, yes we are continuing to eat healthy and drink water.

"Well My weight is a bit better about 205. The last 5 pounds are the hard ones to get off.
I have been running or going to the gym 4 days a week.
However over the past  few days I injured my hamstring so I have just tried to walk it off everyday.can't run.
My blood sugar is good from 99 to 160.
But I just went to Primecare this morning to do my labwork. So I will let you know how that turns out at soon as  I meet with Dr. Zara over the next week or so.
 
I had an eye exam about a month ago. everything was fine on that.

I'm back in NC. Oklahoma was amazing. God showed up and showed off.  ;o)  Many lives changed, including mine. I'm thankful for every prayer covering me (especially since a tornado came within one block of us on May 28th!). What an experience. It's a mission trip I'll never forget.

I?m not finding an update on you, but since I?ve been out of state and away from my desk, I may have missed it.

"Update
Since our last conversation I decided to leave resign my position as Director of Nursing in long term care and so am in process of looking for another position. Good news is I have returned to the gym 3-4 times a week. Lost 5 lbs. Went away on buisness and pleasure 3 times for 3 weeks and managed to maintain weight. 217lbs A1C was 7.1 at last visit. Due again on July 11th  see MD week after. BP 120/70. All other labs were normal. Feel good. Stepping up my exercise routine. Walking 25-30minutes. Start at 3.0 @ 4.5 incline. Decrease incline over 15 minutes and increase speed to 3.4. Doing 150 crunches- up form 50! Work out arms, chest, legs and back too. Work out about 1.5 hours total. Portion control and snacking are my biggest problem. Starting eating dinner earlier so I can do an activity after dinner. This helps. Working on motivatiing myself to continue each day with changes. Goal is to go 21 days right now and maintain my diet changes and exercise level. Testing my blood glucose more frequently to help me monitor. Thyroid levels are getting lower. MD does not think we need to treat at present but will monitor q 3 months.
Glad to hear you were able to help in Oklahoma. Used to volunteer with Red Cross on disaster relief team but only responded to local emergencies.
 
If you need any more information just let me know.

"Hi Kim, Hope things are well with you and your family. Things are well with me and am maintaining my exiting weight with no changes.
My numbers were so good in March 2013, and Dr. Wendy wanting me to visit her in September to have all tests done.
However I did see her today to look at a mole on my leg and they check my A1C and it was 6.3.

I am having some pain in my left leg from the buttocks area down the back of my leg to feet. I have had this the last 4-5 years.
It just got worse since I am now working 2 part-time jobs. I work for USA Today in the early mornings and then about 15 hours per week
with Food line. They made me an appointment 07/01/13 with Triangle Orthopedics? in Durham.                                                                     I have an appointment on 07/29/13 with Goldsboro Skin Center to remove the mole.
Thanks and have a blessed day

Message left on answering machine, requesting member call to discuss labs 
"Hi Kim,
I hope you are doing well.
I am happy to say that I have dropped 2 pounds from my last e-mail to you..
My weight is now 210.  I have a long way to go, but I feel like I am doing
well.   My weight had actually crept up after I e-mailed you, but I have
re-lost it and lost the two additional.  I really believe that dieting has a lot to do with your brain and I think I may have my head right this time.
I have started primarily eating fruits, vegetables, beans, and a small amount of whole grains each day.  I can't say that I stick to this every day, but I have more good days than bad.  I feel like this is giving me more energy and I believe my skin looks better.
I have also been able to stop taking Zantac!!! YAY!!!  I am so happy that I have one less thing to take.
I've started exercising more frequently.  I'm walking / running and doing some toning videos.
Unfortunately, my blood pressure still isn't great.  It was 140/90 today.
Since I am on blood pressure medicine, that is concerning to me.  I am scheduled to have blood work at my primary doctor on Monday and a physical on Tuesday.  I plan to discuss the blood pressure medicine with him.  He originally prescribed it to me because I was retaining fluid and my blood pressure was borderline.  At first, the medicine really seemed to help.
Lately, I have been noticing more swelling in my feet and hands.  I will definitely discuss this with him.
Once I have my blood work, I will be happy to forward you the results.
Have a great weekend,

I had an eye appointment yesterday and they checked my blood pressure.  I wasn't expecting them to do so, so I didn't have time to get white coat syndrome.  It was 112/82.

"Hello Kim,
I saw my doctor today for my physical.  He was very pleased with my weight loss progress.  He also was satisfied that the blood pressure medicine I am currently taking is enough and does not see any reason to change.  He was also happy with my blood work.  He acknowledged that there is room for improvement, but felt that I am making progress.  I have attached a copy of the blood work for you.

Have a great week.

08/19/13 R/C Becky req info on wellness.  Wanting to know when she could have another wellness exam.  Only clm 2013 is for mammo. States she has been having pelv pain ...calling GYN & no appts till Jan 2014. Suggested she call her family phys & explain possibly they could do exam or maybe refer her to GYN. Appreciative will keep me posted.
08/19/13 R/C to Becky re questions she had about herself.  I then brought up healthy rewards for Roy.  Exp that labwork rec from phys was for 2011.  Entered what I had; however will not get full reward.  She states he had extensive labwork done thru VA.  Will have them forward.  No clms 2013 to make a current impact for healthy rewards at this point.
Met to do DOB #5.  She said she had a rough weekend going to the fair.  Wt 183.  Put on 2lbs from last week.  BS was 108.  30 day average was 109.  Just had more blood work done through her doctor.  Eating well and drinking less diet coke.  
DOB #5
"Good morning!  Have a question/concern for you....... 
  
I had some routine blood work done a couple of weeks ago at my doctor's office and they just called me back yesterday.  He is wanting to put me on Zocor.  Cholesterol was 211 and LDL was 126.  Both high of course.  He wants me to take the Zocor for a month and then come back for another fasting blood panel.   

I've never been on a daily medication before and not so thrilled about the idea.  I just want to make sure that this is a medication that I can possibly come off of at a later day when I ever manage to get some weight off maybe?? 

Just wanted to get your thoughts on this, please :-) 

"
"The results your doctor gave you are very similar to your results from 10/2012.  Then your total cholesterol was 213, HDL 58, LDL 131, triglycerides 119.  I say that to let you know that this is not a new elevation, but it has been elevated for at least close to a year.  
Your doctor may feel that you need Zocor at this time since it has been elevated for a while.  Did you have the chance to discuss options with your doctor?  
Options would be some or all of the following:   weight loss, low fat diet, exercise, natural ways to decrease cholesterol and LDL with increased fiber, fish oil, garlic, foods that help decrease these levels like oatmeal, etc.  These options do take a longer time before you  see results and are not a guaranteed method but some folks do have success. 
However, your doctor is looking at the whole picture of your health, family history,  lifestyle and stress level and is probably taking all that into consideration when making a decision to try Zocor.
There are people who can take cholesterol meds and eventually come off the cholesterol meds with lifestyle changes.  There are also people who cannot come off cholesterol meds even with lifestyle changes due to the cholesterol elevations being a more genetic, family trait issue.  
I understand you not wanting to start a daily medication.  
Can you schedule a time to go in a speak with your doctor and discuss all of the above?  I would ask:  1. Can you take a little more time to try lifestyle changes?  Or does he feel that you really need to begin Zocor now?
2. What does he think about the chances of you being able to come off of Zocor in the future?
3. Discuss elevation being caused by current lifestyle/medical condition or does he feel that it is more genetic?  Do you know your family history regarding cholesterol issues?  

I know that is a long answer but?
Yes some people are able to reduce or go completely off of cholesterol meds after lifestyle or circumstance changes, of course  with the permission of the doctor.  

I hope that helps and please let me now the outcome!

"Hi ______

Thank you for the email.  I wanted to follow up with you from the medical screening at MAG Mutual in May.  On your  Know Your Number screening, your HgbA1c level was 6.1, which indicates you?re your average blood glucose level is slightly elevated.  I have attached 2 articles that explain HgbA1c and explains the elevated risk for developing diabetes.  
We do not diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes but note that this lab indicates an elevated risk.  
We encourage you to follow up with your physician, if you have not already done so, to discuss your HgbA1c and all of your Know Your Number results.

"Hello Kim, 

I do not have a very good update for you.  I have fallen off the wagon and gained a few pounds.  I don't really have any excuses, other than I am just tiered of trying.  I am not stuffing my face by no means, but have not drank enough water and not eating the best foods either.  I have an outing August first, so I have decided to try to loose a few pounds before that so that I do not have to buy any more clothes. That is my new goal. 

Talk to you soon. 
"
"Sorry for the delayed response. 
Sorry that you fell off the wagon. Hope you are back on again. You are worth it girl. You can do it!
Try adding lemon or lime or even cucumber to your water. You can take a few slices to work in a lunch box or fix your water before you leave home and just keep adding ice and water all day. 
You were only a few pounds short of returning to your pre-pregnancy wt. 
What is your current wt? 
Are you still doing boot camp or walking?
Let me hear from you regarding the questions above (I underlined for ease.)
Then I?ll see you at the KYN screening in Sept.
We will start over fresh again.  ;o)
Are you using the ?tips? sheet?
Let me know how I can help you.

"Hey Kim, 

Sorry for getting around to the update so late.  If you remember, my main goal we set was to pack on some muscle, and continue to workout, while trying to eat healthy.  If I had to give a status update to this, I'd say I'm about halfway there to my goal.  I hit my target weight (180lbs), but not really the way I wanted to.  I haven't worked out as much as I'd like to, and cut out cardio.  So now I have some work to do, to keep my weight up, but lower my body fat %.  I'd probably be happy being anywhere between 175-190.   

My plan from here on out is to bring cardio back in play (running, swimming, and golf if that counts),  lift weights at least 3 days a week, and change my eating habits again. 

I don't really remember my numbers from the sheet, but I think the only area that needed attention was how many times I eat red meats a week. 

Do you have any information on ways I could accurately measure my body fat percentage? 
"
"Thanks for the update ....... 
Yay! Congrats to gaining the 8 pounds. 
  
The best way to lose fat (and not muscle) is to lower your heart rate during your work out with wts. There is a calculation per your wt, ht, gender &amp;amp; age for where your heart should be for cardio and for fat burning. For cardio it should be at a higher rate to work your heart (for instance mine is 130-150 with spurts of 160). For fat burning, it should be much lower (for instance mine is 110-120).  If I walk in a stroll, it doesn?t get my heart up enough for fat burn, but a moderate walk does. A fast walk is too high of a rate, so a fast walk would be ?cardio?. Does this make sense? If you go to a gym, any trainer can help you find those numbers or you can google it. Check this article out.:  http://www.livestrong.com/article/208307-how-to-calculate-heart-rate-for-fat-burn/ . 
  
Most machines, like a treadmill or elliptical machine will tell you what your heart rate is. They are not always dependable, according to whether they have been calibrated lately or not. I highly suggest the purchase of a ?polar? system or something similar. It?s a watch and a band which goes around your chest. It will tell you what your heart rate is, your max during your work out when you are done, your minimum heart rate during your workout (when you are done), your avg heart rate from your work out, calories burned, etc. It?s made the biggest difference for my workouts, simply because I can work out anywhere anytime and be able to keep my heart rate where it needs to be. One of my best friends is currently on St. Maarten island. She worked out yesterday &amp;amp; knew she was keeping her heart rate at the right rate AND burned the fat calories she wanted to burn. She owns a gym in Roanoke Rapids and sells these. They are around $100. Well worth the money. I use mine every day &amp;amp; I don?t have to work out in a gym or on limited machines. This is great for working out with wts too. You can probably google them and find them for sale online. Not sure if its water proof or not (so you could wear it in the pool). Are you swimming? 
Does this make sense? 
  
The only place I know where you can go to measure your body fat is a gym. Even if you don?t have a membership, you could ?visit? one. All they do is enter your ht, wt, gender, age on a hand held electronic device, then you squeeze it?s handles as hard as you can for a minute and it gives you a read. 
Hope this helps. 
So proud of you. You are starting great habits as a young person?for a healthy lifestyle. Keep up the good work. It will pay off and you are WORTH it! When others ?wake up? in their 40s or when they have an unfortunate event, you will already be living a healthy lifestyle, AND you can point them in the right direction. Prevention is key. Good job!!! 
  
Please answer the underlined questions in your reply asap, then send your next update before the end of Aug. Please place this on your calendar or a place of reminder. Ok? 
  
Warm Regards, 
Kim

"Thanks for all the helpful information!  I will definitely look into tracking my heart rate better during workouts.  I know it is relatively low when lifting weights, but not sure about cardio.  I've just started doing sprints in the field behind my apartments, and then I try to do HIITs on the elliptical or bike.  I had no idea it should be lower for fat burning.  Thank you! 

Yes, I'm trying to start swimming.  Right now, it mainly consists of being lazy and laying on a raft!  I do try to swim laps for 10-15 minutes each time I get in though. 

Thanks for the information about body fat as well.  I've seen a few different scales that claim to measure body fat, but wasn't sure how accurate of a reading it would be. 
Here is the one I was looking at in case you were interested: http://gdgt.com/fitbit/aria/ .  It's actually pretty cool.  Takes all your measurement charts, and uploads them via WiFi!

"Good afternoon Kim,
I did get a PSA 6 months ago. Current weight is 240.
Trying to eat more salads and grilled food since the weather has warmed up.
All the fresh vegetables are awesome.
 
I have been trying to get some walking in and also .....(spouse)... and I have been

Member called in at 10:55 am in response to a letter she received regarding completing the biometric screening requirements.  States she had labs done but misplaced her questionnaire.  Advised that I will check to see if it can still be submitted and call her back.  Verified with member that a good phone number to reach her at is 803-529-2246.

"Hi Kim,
I hope you are doing well. Just wanted to check in with you.
My weight is 182 lbs. Blood pressure is 119/81.
I've been working outside more the last 2 months and not eating as many big meals, so I think this has help me to loose weight. Everything else is pretty much the same.
 
Let me know if you need any other info.
 
Thanks,
"
"Good morning,

I have lost 10 lbs. yay me! Trying to walk everyday at least 3 miles. Have even become &amp;quot;mall walker&amp;quot; with a co worker during part of our lunch, Yes getting old. LOL.

Looking forward to a week of vacation coming up the end of this week thru next week.

Spoke with member regarding health goal-- weight loss.  See attached notes from 2012 under care plan.  Continues to drink only one soft drink every several weeks and no coffee or tea.  Drinking water.  Not eating after dinner meal.  Cooking at home, not stopping at fast food restaurants.  Still feeling better on awakening but not sleeping well. Has not rechecked BP. Does not know current weight.  Weight 3/13 was 344 lbs.  Discussed sleep habits--routine sleep hours, calming activity 30 min prior to sleep. Has been walking around block for 20 min on some evenings.  Encouraged increasing time and pace of walks at least 4 times per week.   Will check weight and BP and report to CM.  Will do KYN screening again 10/13.  
"Hi Kim, 

Glad you made it back safely from OK - hope all went well. 

I'm making progress on my goals.  I'm back in the habit of exercising most evenings - 5 usually, sometimes 6 -  and I've worked up to 45-60 minutes each time.  I either walk outside or do a Leslie Sansone video.  I'm still drinking my water - only water - and trying to get in fruits and veggies.  I have discovered over the past couple of weeks how much I like turkey burgers - they have about the third of the calories as in beef burgers (and less fat) - and they taste just as good.  This week I've tried grilled turkey &amp;quot;chops&amp;quot; too. I'm having turkey and veggies for lunch this week.  I'm a big turkey fan now.  I'm thinking I'll try kale next week - I'm looking for ways to prepare it now. 

The scales aren't really budging - maybe a tiny bit - and that's really discouraging.  I feel like I've been working hard.  I'm tracking my food and stay around 1300-1600 calories a day. The weekends are a challenge sometimes, and I probably eat a little more then, but I'm moving lots more too.  I use a HRM during exercise but only count about 80% of the estimated calories burned, most nights that's around 600.   

If you have any advice or tips for me, I'd love to hear it! 
"
"Sorry for the delayed reply. 
Great report!
So proud of you for tracking your food! That?s a great way to daily evaluate how/what you are eating. 
Are you using the tip sheet I sent you? Adding a tip/week or a tip/month to your lifestyle?
You may want to make your range of calories between 1300-1400 instead of 1300-1600. 
Another thing to watch is ?how are you getting those calories??. 
From protein, green veggies, fruit? Good.
From Saturated fat, starchy veggies or white foods? Not good. 
I?m betting you need to reduce your carb intake (not from whole fresh fruit which has fiber), but from starches (breads, cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes). 
Hope this is helpful.
Let me know if I can help you further.
If you want to send me your food tracking report, you can print it from sparkpeople, then scan it into your computer, then email it to me as an attachment. 
I can look it over and make recommendations. What do your think? 
I look forward to seeing you at the KYN screening on Sept 24th.
Warm Regards,
Kim

"Hi Kim, 
All is well!  I have been walking on the nice afternoons for at least 45 minutes per day.  I've also started back sitting on my exercise ball at work.  Overall I have maintain my weight.  I may gain &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; pound and loose &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; pound.  I'm still drinking water and I'm still including fruits to my diet. No big change to report this time.  Hopefully my next report will be a little better than this one. 

Hope you have a great  4th of July!!!!

"Hey ......,
I received your make up quiz for the Pre-diabetes class via fax. 
Just a quick note to let you know that #8 is incorrect. Watermelon is the worst on the glycemic index of fruits.
It shoots your blood sugar sky high and quickly. (Eggs &amp;amp; chicken are low glycemic index foods.)
Also #12 was wrong. Eating after 6pm has nothing to do with cholesterol.
To lower chol, the lifestyle choice would be (D) eat whole grains, fresh produce &amp;amp; fish rich in Omega fats such as salmon.
I gave you credit for this quiz. 
Please take the few minutes it takes to go through one more power point and send me an additional make up quiz by the end of Aug.
That will bring you up to compliance. 
Cristy has done 2 classes (what is required), but I only have one on file for you.
Thanks.

"Kim, 

I went for my annual physical a few weeks ago.  My doctor was happy that my weight was holding steady and suggested I see my obgyn even though to discuss periomenopause. I have an appointment next month.   

I have worked my way up to 6 miles in running and am on track for the half marathon in October.  I've recently let sugar slip into my diet with some recent travel on vacation and business.  I'm working my way to back to a regular schedule now that I am home for a while.  Otherwise I feel great.

"Hello Kim, 

I do not have a very good update for you.  I have fallen off the wagon and gained a few pounds.  I don't really have any excuses, other than I am just tiered of trying.  I am not stuffing my face by no means, but have not drank enough water and not eating the best foods either.  I have an outing August first, so I have decided to try to loose a few pounds before that so that I do not have to buy any more clothes. That is my new goal. 

Talk to you soon. 
"
"...., 
Sorry for the delayed response. 
Sorry that you fell off the wagon. Hope you are back on again. You are worth it girl. You can do it! 
Try adding lemon or lime or even cucumber to your water. You can take a few slices to work in a lunch box or fix your water before you leave home and just keep adding ice and water all day. 
You were only a few pounds short of returning to your pre-pregnancy wt. 
What is your current wt? 
Are you still doing boot camp or walking? 
Let me hear from you regarding the questions above (I underlined for ease.) 
Then I?ll see you at the KYN screening in Sept. 
We will start over fresh again.  ;o) 
Are you using the ?tips? sheet? 
Let me know how I can help you. 
"
"Morning Kim, 

I do try to drink water and diet green tea (if i get tiered of water).  I am at 145 and it is horrible. I am not doing boot camp anymore, I just couldnt stay up at night and I was so sleepy that I just didnt want to do anything.  I have got to do something and I want to, but on the other hand I am just tiered of trying to.  Guess I am in a slump right now. 

I leave this week to go out of town for work and my goal is to get back on it when I return.   

Trying to keep my head up and know I can do it. 

See you at the screening.

Please find my make up review and quiz. I thought it would be easier to e-mail. 
"Kim, 

I was asked by you to report back this month. I had a foot injury while on vacation actually it started out as gout, then went to arthritis and was treated with Prednisone. It was thought it may be a stress fracture due to the weight used in my calf raises of around 330 lbs. The found no fracture and found a bone spur in the heal of my left foot, but it has never bothered me. My BP while at the beach was 143/73 not average but not bad. I am afraid I have not lost, or gained any weight and now that I am back home have started working out again. 

That is it for now. 
"
"Thanks for the quick reply.
Unfortunately your answers are incorrect on 2 very important questions.
Not only are they wrong, they are the worst answers you could pick for those questions.
Question # 8, regarding Glycemic Index foods, answer is ?C? eggs &amp;amp; chicken, not ?D? watermelon &amp;amp; rice (the highest in glycemic index).
Question #10, regarding Wt, answer is ?C? not ?B?. Weight DOES have lots to do with diabetes. That?s why diet, exercise and maintaining a normal BMI/Wt is so important. 
I will still give you credit for the quiz, but please note, these classes are to give you the information you need to improve your health or maintain it.

I understand you are very busy, but I hope you will take time to invest in yourself by actively pursuing a healthy lifestyle &amp;amp; participating in Soaring to Health wellness program. 
I hope to see you at the KYN screening, Sept. 24th. Remember to fast, but drink plenty of water and take your normal medications.
Warm Regards,
Kim

"Just thought I would touch base before I got too busy with our outing next week.  I hope all is well. 
?	I have been trying to exercise at lest 3 times a week or go a little longer and do 2.  My thought process is 30 Minutes. 
?	I have really been watching what I eat.  I have been staying with the protein bars and fruits.  Lately I have been eating plums.  I actually enjoy those.  I have been trying to find a good tart apple, but its hard to do.  Most of them are mushy.  I really try to stay away from bread, fried foods and ribeyes.  I have eaten a couple filets, one elk and one ribye over the last month and a half, which is really good for me.  I am also having no more that one glass of sweet tea per day, but usually only one half.  This healthy eating is about to kill me.  It's not fun, but I can't say I am miserable any more.  I guess my stomach has probably shrunk.  For the most part the headaches have subsided.  I have lost somewhere between 9-12 lbs over the last 30 days.  My prior weight differentiated by 3 to 5 lbs before and now there is only 1 to 1/2 lb for morning to evening.  Any way, I weigh around 154-155.   
?	I am supposed to go back to the doctor for an urine sample, which I haven't done yet.  They spotted blood, but when they sent it off, everything was fine, so she wanted me to go back. 
?	I am also supposed to go to a dermatologists about a few spots on my nose.  I haven't go around to that yet either. 
?	Finally my goal is to go back to the doctor in October to re-check my numbers.

Let me know if this is enough info and have a good one. 
"
"Yay! I?m so proud of you!!  Only one glass of sweet tea/day!!! Awesome!
Yep.  If men stop drinking calories, they always lose wt. It?s not even fair.  ;o(  
Try to replace the empty calories you were taking in (from the sugar in the sweet tea), with healthy foods which have nutritional value.
You don?t want to lose more wt and fly away with the next wind.
Wow. You are going all out and doing everything. Good job exercising 3x/week &amp;amp; making healthy choices on your food and drink intake. 
A great tart apple would be ?Granny Smith? apples. They are commonly in the grocery stores and are the best apples to use for a pie.

Remember to make your follow up appt with your doctor (for a urine sample). Have you had your annual PSA (sorry if I?ve asked you before)? ?and for your dermatologist appt too.
Lets make that your next goal: to make both appts and keep them. You agree?

Everything looks great. Congrats!!!
Just answer the questions above, then shoot me an email in Aug between the 1st and 10th,  giving me an update with your current wt and let me know if you need help with anything.  
OK?
Keep up the good work. 
Warm Regards,
Kim
"
I have had my annual (well not annual) physical and PSA was fine.  This was when they saw blood, but when sent off, it was negative.  There was just not an EKG performed. 
"Thanks.
I look forward to hearing from you in Aug between the 1st and 10th. All I?ll need is your current wt and where you stand with the sweet tea.  ;o)

"Hi Kim,
Hope that you are doing well!  I went this week and had my physical/pap for the year.  I assume that everything was good, I haven't heard otherwise.
I took my blood pressure this morning and it was 129/87 and my weight was 126.  I am playing on a tennis team this fall and trying to go to the gym 3 times a week now that my daughter is back in school.  The end of July/beginning of August, I was slack because we were on vacation and my kids childcare wasn't full day so I didn't have a lot of time to get to the gym.  However, now that she has started school I have been able to get back in the swing of things.  I hope that you are doing well and will see you in September.

"My apologies for being late.  I thought I had a calendar reminder set, but it seems to have vanished!  Hope you are doing well.

I am doing okay with my goal to stay on track with my Crestor.  I had a delay getting it refilled when we switched to BCBS.  It took 6 weeks to get a refill.  So, that sort of through a kink in my routine and I'm trying to get back on it.  I have put the bottle on my night stand next to where I plug in my phone to charge.  I'm hoping that will help me remember to take it every night.

My husband and I are making strides to make healthier food options when we can.  I got a bit frustrated because I went for several weeks that I was really trying to cut back and work out and I actually gained weight?!  So, that was discouraging.  Current weight is 161.  We are walking and/or riding bikes 2-3 times a week.  We road 6 miles last night!  This beautiful weather has really made it easier to want to get outside and be active!

"Haha. I totally understand ........ As many sticky notes, calendar reminders and smart phone alarms I set up, I still miss stuff. Grace. Grace!
I am doing well minus a rare type of tendonitis. With a little time and immobility I'll be fine.  ;o) Just thanking God it's my left hand and not my right.
 In the mean time I'm sporting a bright pink brace. ;o)

So sorry you missed several weeks of chol med. Did you talk with the pharmacist to see if he/she could get that resolved without missing days of medication? They can usually allow you to &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; the medication until the &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; in the sys tem works out. Sorry that happened. Have you heard of &amp;quot;Fat Fighters&amp;quot;? They are over the counter pills you can take to help lower chol/fat uptake (&amp;amp; inhibits carb uptake too). You take 1 pill 15-60 minutes after you eat lunch and dinner or take 2 after your highest fat/carb meal that day. I'm a distributor and sell it. It's much cheaper than most copays (though you should never quit taking prescription medications without your doctor's permission). You can take it in addition to your medications too, to enhance your chol reduction results and to keep from gaining wt from the fat you eat at those meals when you use it. I've included my testimony of how it changed my chol from 250 this April to 182 in July. I hadn't even taken it 2 full months. All the products I sell are all natural with NO fillers. So they work. Let me know if you are interested. DDHC does not sell or endorse any products I sell. (It's my part time business, trying to help folks become healthier &amp;amp; I'm working on becoming debt free.)

Great job on making healthier food choices!  Sorry that you gained wt after being so good on your diet. 
Great job at riding your bikes! Wow! Six miles is great. Yes, I love the cooler temps and sunshine combo. I've been riding with my convertible top down and enjoying every minute of it. 
One thing you may want to try...track your nutrition (calories, saturated fat, fiber, carbs, protein) &amp;amp; track your calories burned. 
You can track your nutrition on &amp;quot;sparkpeople&amp;quot; via their website (free) or a smart phone app for it ($3.99 but well worth the convenience).
The best most accurate way to track your calories is to wear a device on your body which will tell you how many calories you burn during your workout. I use one called &amp;quot;Polar&amp;quot;, but there are plenty out there to choose from. Mine cost 99$, but I've seen some at Wal-Mart for 1/2 the price.  You want to burn 250 calories 7 days a week to lose 1 pound/week. If you reduce your caloric intake by 250/day AND burn 250/day, you will lose 2 pounds/week. After your KYN screening &amp;amp; we get your results, I'd love to talk with you on the phone when you aren't pressed for time (mid October?). 

Take care. I look forward to seeing you at the KYN screening on Sept 24th. Remember to fast, but drink lots of water and take your normal meds.

Met to go over blood results.  She said her and her doctor reviewed her results and he felt everything looked fine.  Made her aware of her glucose number and to keep an eye on it.  No additional questions. 
Went over results. 
"Please forgive me if I?m wrong, but I have you listed as either past due for an update for July OR in need of an update before the end of Aug.
So please send me an update. 
Please do not just verbalize that you are doing fine or the same. 
 
?         Your update should be related to your goal 
?         Include detailed information related to your action plans (how to reach your goal)
?          Additionally, if you have a health condition (high chol, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma) please update me on how your numbers are with said condition (BS, BP, latest chol, last MD appt, next MD appt, etc.) &amp;amp; how well you are managing that condition
?         How you are doing with eating healthy
?         How you are doing with your exercise plans
 
I hope to see you all at the KYN screening on Sept 24th. 
Remember to fast, but drink plenty of water and take the normal medications you would take on a daily basis.
Thanks,

"Don't know if I had an update due or not but I'll give you one if you want it.  I'm still busy being awesome.  There are no health conditions that I have unless you count grey hair but that is easily albeit expensively controlled.  
 
My awesome and amazing Zumba instructors took this week off for back to school.  We're back on next week but I've been going to class twice a week all summer.  I've been extra soggy after class.  I've been running a bit too although I took a few weeks off to let my IT bands rest.  They had been causing much pain and I didn't want to soar into major injury.  Unfortunately, my yoga/pilates class was cancelled to make way for a program for the super-obese.  A worthy cause but my loss for now.  
 
It's August and the farmers are harvesting.  We've been enjoying some of the fresh vegetables and corn that we have locally.  We grew our own broccoli, tomatoes and basil.  Lots of basil!  My goal is to have a sufficient stash of pesto in the freezer for winter.  Since it is summer, the occasional ice cream is on the menu too.  We do everything in moderation.  The apples are ripening and picking has begun.  Hooray!
 
That's it.
"
"Great update! (Your?s was not past due, just due before the end of Aug.) Thanks ...! You are sooo funny.
Great job at exercising and making good choices in your diet. Keep up the good work. You are WORTH it!
Hope to see you the 24th for the KYN screening. 
Remember to fast, but drink plenty of water and take any normal medications.

"Hey Kim, 
Sorry for the delay. I have been slacking on my goals somewhat lately. I have continued to cut out all soft drinks and cut out sugar consumption but I have not been cooking at night lately which is causing me to eat less healthy. I will try to get back into my groove of cooking healthy meals.
See you in September.

Thanks,

Met to go over blood results.  She said she has a strong history of high choleserol in her family.  TC was just over 200.  HDL's were nice and high.  Everything looked good overall.  No additional questions. 
Went over results. 
Met to go over blood results.  He said he is choosing to eat the way he has.  He said he is not concerned.  He knows he needs to watch a little more of what he eats, but he says he is choosing not to right now.  Appreciates the follow up though. 
Went over results. 
Met to go over results.  He is on lipitor.  Has a genetics of diabetes in his family.  Eats very well.  Sees his doctors on a regular basis.  No additional questions.

well, his snoring is worse, and he ignores my requests to go do the sleep apnea thing.  A girl here at work, talks about how much better her husband feels and acts since getting on his.  He's a work-a-holic - so, the thoughts of having dr appointments because of this - well, it just doesn't fit into his schedule.  I keep trying though.  He has a dr appointment later this week, so I'll see if I can poke him a bit with that too. 
Yay! Great job .............! Thanks!!!
Met to go over blood results.  Made her aware of her TC number and how she can help improve that number.  No additional questions. 
"me: 
dealing with the stress of having now a 13 year old that's having anxiety issues;  Not wanting to leave home, actually got her to talk about some of it Sunday,and she admitted she didn't want to be away from me or Charles, for fear of getting hurt, and us not being there;  She plays sports, and she has gotten hurt before in a game, but we were there.  I assured her there'd not be a game where we weren't there.  Too much to get into in an email here - but long story short, she is a different child than what she was 6 months ago;  Can be very withdrawn, and I've let it go, thinking she was trying to be &amp;quot;independent&amp;quot;.  Now I realize, my letting her withdraw to her room, has only made matters worse, but at least we're on the same page now as to what's going on, and what we can do to try to deal with it, learn from it, etc. 
As far as health-wise - well, I haven't allowed time for me, or anything regarding me in about 6 months now - - but, school is back in session, my oldest is back at college, so, while I try to make more time for my 13 yr old, in it - I try to make time for me, too - -  at least I'm starting to fix my water jug now - which I haven't done in about 4 months.... 
I finally got set up with a new doctor (been trying since April) - and they'll do their official blood work the next time I go (in November).

Member returned KYN fu call. She states she has seen her MD regarding her KYN results.  BP was elevated on screening but she states it is controlled with meds and MD follows.  Indicated that she did not need to speak with nurse regarding results since she has seen her MD recently. L Canady
"Glad to hear you are starting your water jug and have a new MD. Hopefully you can take your KYN results to your Nov appt. 
Touchy subject?
Regarding your 13yo daughter, It ?could? possibly be that the ?traumatic? event was the injury &amp;amp; fear of being alone that started these sudden changes. But I?m feeling a red flag. Please consider gently approaching her (with counsel from professionals maybe) to see if some other ?event? has occurred to make her afraid and insecure. It just makes me wonder if something sexual has occurred and she is feeling trapped, afraid to ?tell?, but taking extra measures to make sure you and ...(spouse)... are near her (so ?something? can?t happen again). God forbid I?m on the right track, but I can?t sit here and not mention it. I?ve witnessed it too many times. I highly recommend that you ask a professional about how to approach her. You don?t want her to feel more ?shame? if something has happened and you don?t want  to back her in a corner (trying to force her to tell you), that would make her feel like you aren?t on her side and increase her general fear and fear of abandonment. I encourage you to think back to the timing of her ?change? &amp;amp; try to think of any times she wasn?t with you. Who?s supervision was she under (after school? At school? Neighbors home? Girl friend?s home?)? Ask God to show you what?s going on. No matter what it is. If you ask, He will bring it to light and give you wisdom how to handle it. I will be praying for you. Sorry to bring this up, but again, because I?m a nurse, a mom, a Christian and have a heart for people, I can?t be silent. 
Warm Regards,
Kim

If he has sleep apnea and obtains a CPAP &amp;amp; uses it, he will feel better and sleep better. His immune system will be better able to fight germs/illnesses. He will have more energy and feel as ?old? as he has. I had the same experience. It changed everything. That?s when I started on my health journey. It enabled me to do that. Please share that with him. 
Called to f/u with member on the outcome of her MD visit.  Left message for her to return my call. 
Left message for member to return my call re: important KYN results.  Also mailed letter to member asking that she contact me regarding her results.  
Met to do TOB #3.  He said he has decided to try and cut back some b/c his daughter and wife have been on him.  He says he still does not want to quit, but he is going to make an effort not to chew as much.  
TOB #3
"Completed  quizzes for classes and submitted to you so compliant. 

Down to 205 and working toward 195. Still walking daily and starting to cut back on caffine (lord help me) but going good otherwise. BP checked the other day was 112/78."
"Right. You don't need to send any more quizzes.

Thanks for the update. Your's was due the end of July. I'm a little slow in my own reply. Grace. Grace. ;o)
Glad you are cutting down on caffeine. One cup of coffee or its equivalent is ok. No biggie.

What are you doing to lose wt? 
You are actually 3 #s heavier than you were last KYN screening on Oct. 2nd, 2012.
Did you cut out eating after 7pm? We discussed that and cutting down your portions, carbs, &amp;amp; saturated fats.

What is your heart rate range for cardio exercise?
What is your heart rate range for fat burning?

A pound of fat is 3500 calories. 
If you burn 250 calories every day you could lose 1#/week.
If you reduce your diet by 250 calories/day in addition, you could lose 2#s/week. 

Have you tried tracking your diet for just a couple of weeks to see where you are taking in more than you burn?
Sparkpeople is a great  way to track nutrition. You can do that via website on your pc or there is an app for smart phones.
We will need to make more detailed plans post KYN. 

Hope this helps.
Great BP!!! Keep up the good work. 
See you on the 24th.

"Hi Kim, 

Hope you are having a great summer!  I am doing good.  Went to the doctor about a month ago just for meds check for my acid reflux and blood pressure was 120/78 and weight was 210.  I've lost 12 lbs since last October.  I am eating plenty of fresh veggies and enjoyed snacking on strawberries when were in season.  I have had a busy busy summer one son got married June 8th and my other son gets married Aug 3rd, so I am just trying to hold on!  Wedding showers parties and receptions are not always diet friendly lol.  But I'm holding on and strolling my grand daughter in the evenings when its not raining!  Hope you have a great day!  Let me know if you need additional information.  Thanks!

"Hi Kim, 

I have had a very busy summer sorry if I got behind on emailing.  The last thing I sent you was the end of June.  Goals set at the beginning of the year: 

1. Cut down on soft drinks and substitute with water, 2. Start exercise at least 3 times a week 3.  Increase fruits and veggies in my diet 4.  Start planning meals in advance so I will eat healthier. 

I have cut out all soda except for 1-2 per day which is great for me! 
Exercise still needs work.  I need to start riding my bike again, I will make that a goal this week. 
I have been eating lots of fresh veggies and fruit.  I still need to keep increasing.  I have started grilling veggies and fruit and we love that. 
I have been planning supper weekly so this is great I just have to keep it up and not forget before shopping!  I seem to forget to plan lunch which leads to bad decisions, so I need to work on this. 

My weight is around the same at 213 or 212,  so still down a little from last year.

Met to do TOB #1.  She has quit once before for about 9 months.  Recently she tried the E- cigarette.  Doctor is always on her.  Stress is a huge factor in smoking.  Son went to prison for 135years, lost her job, daughter has issues.  Smoking 40years.  1 pack a day.  Tried chantix before did not work well.  Goal: no smoking in her vehicle

Met to go over results.  He said his BS will spike on him from time to time.  He said his last A1c was around 5.8.  I had him at 6.6 and BS 149.  He test everyday and it is usually below 110.  Walks at least 30 minutes a day.  
Went over results. 
"Great update.......
Glad to hear you are taking advantage of lots of fresh veg/fruits and grilling them?oh they are soooo delish grilled!! My favorite!
Great job planning ahead for suppers. An idea for you: buy/cook enough to have left overs for lunch the next day.
Sometimes I?ll cook a 9x13 pan of Nutty Chicken and a 9x13 pan of baked fish on the weekend. Then put it in containers so I have my lunches set apart. Just an idea. 
It sounds like you are doing better AND not beating yourself up when you don?t do perfectly. Good job!!
You kept your MD appt and are keeping your BP under control.
Everyone slips here and there when things get busy or we get sick, etc. Just jump back in with your bike, etc. 
I look forward to seeing you on the 24th.
Warm Regards,
Kim

"Completed  quizzes for classes and submitted to you so compliant. 

Down to 205 and working toward 195. Still walking daily and starting to cut back on caffine (lord help me) but going good otherwise. BP checked the other day was 112/78."
"Right. You don't need to send any more quizzes.

Thanks for the update. Your's was due the end of July. I'm a little slow in my own reply. Grace. Grace. ;o) Glad you are cutting down on caffeine. One cup of coffee or its equivalent is ok. No biggie.

What are you doing to lose wt? 
You are actually 3 #s heavier than you were last KYN screening on Oct. 2nd, 2012.
Did you cut out eating after 7pm? We discussed that and cutting down your portions, carbs, &amp;amp; saturated fats.

What is your heart rate range for cardio exercise?
What is your heart rate range for fat burning?

A pound of fat is 3500 calories. 
If you burn 250 calories every day you could lose 1#/week.
If you reduce your diet by 250 calories/day in addition, you could lose 2#s/week. 

Have you tried tracking your diet for just a couple of weeks to see where you are taking in more than you burn?
Sparkpeople is a great  way to track nutrition. You can do that via website on your pc or there is an app for smart phones.
We will need to make more detailed plans post KYN. 

Hope this helps.
Great BP!!! Keep up the good work. 
See you on the 24th.
Kim

Please feel free to email me the information.
"Thank you for your email response. 
Please be reminded that your blood pressure was  elevated at the screening at 138/93.  Have you had the opportunity to have your blood pressure rechecked to ensure that it is normal?   A one time elevation does not indicate a problem, but it is important to monitor your BP and be aware of what it usually runs.  It could have been elevated that day due to the circumstances of having a medical screening at work, rushing to make your appt time, a hectic morning, etc.  But it is good just to recheck and follow up with your physician if your BP consistently is over 120/80.  
Congratulations! Your cholesterol and blood sugar labs are within normal limits. Keep up the good work there.  
I have enclosed some tips on restaurant eating and smart snacking that I hope you will find helpful.
Please contact me if you have questions and need additional educational information about a particular topic.  
Have a healthy day! Lori

"Yes.  My wife buys them from lucky vitamin so they are whole food based. She buys good quality supplements. 

Yes on the whole grain carbs.  I do eat gluten free but we now have a Harris Teeter that makes it easier to buy gluten free food. 

No to the Nicorette.  I will try to cut down but I know I need to get off.  I started the nicorette after I quit mint/certs.  Need to quit it all.  When ........... retired, I took over as .......... and still retained my old duties as .........  So it is stressful but I do a good job of managing it with my assistant Becky and working out.  So.........I will see what I can do to cut it back. 

Hope you are well.  Looking forward to seeing you next month.  You still pumping iron?   

Thanks for your encouragement. 
"
"Great update .... Sorry to take time in your busy schedule. 
I?m still working out, cardio &amp; yes pumping iron too. It?s addictive. When I don?t do it, I feel different.
At the moment I?m nursing a rare type of tendonitis in my left wrist called ?intersection syndrome? or ?crossover tendonitis?.
So I?m sticking to lower body and cardio for the time being. 
With a little immobility (brace) &amp; some TLC I?ll be good as new in a few weeks. Can?t let it stop me.  ;o)
My daughter is home from overseas (mission trip), so I?m enjoying her immensely!!

The reason I asked you about getting your iron checked, is that if you have a low iron level, it can show a false high on your A1c results. 
Last year your A1c was 5.7 (Pre-diabetic level). It was just over the line (5.6 and below = normal). 
Nicotine also can cause a false high A1c. We were trying to get to the bottom of your A1c level being high. 
We will be in touch after we get your next KYN results back, but help me remember &amp; lets readdress this again with your annual MD visit coming up in Nov., if your A1c continues to be above normal levels. OK?

Please bring pics of that precious boy to the screening.  ;o)
Thanks again,
Kim

Left message for member to return my call, also emailed member asking that she return my call regarding important KYN results.  
Letter mailed to member asking that she contact me regarding important KYN results. 
Spoke with member about KYN results. Reviewed fasting glucose 178 and HgbA1c of 8.4.  She is compliant with meds but not as compliant with diet and exercise.  Knee injury and only recently well enough to walk for exercise again.  Will discuss with MD.  Will begin to do better with diet and exercise.  Cholesterol levels normal on meds.  She will let DDHC know about next HgbA1c level after seen by MD&gt;  
"Member returned my call, we reviewed her KYN results:  bp 118/82, wt 271 lbs, ht 49 1/2&quot;, fbs 103, tchol 215, tri 225, hdl 35, ldl 45, a1c 6.6.  
She had gestational diabetes with her pregnancy (delivered seventeen months ago) and was on medication at that time to control her blood sugar. She reports that her blood sugars went back down to normal after delivery, but she hasn't been following her diet like she did during the pregnancy and is not on medication at this time.  She has a family history of diabetes.  She does have increased thirst and frequent urination.    Urged her to make appt with MD ASAP to f'/u on screening results.  She has  polycystic ovarian syndrome.    Encouraged her to go back to eating the way she had before to help control her blood sugars, and increase her exercise in the meantime until she sees her MD.  Faxed labs to MD.  "
SIG comp;iance program, quarterly update
SIG compliance quarterly update
Quarterly update. Doing well. Met goal of gaining weight. Just began running again.  Still has not gotten physical with MD. New goal to find MD and have full physical.  
"I am doing excellent eating healthy.
I am doing excellent exercising.
My current weight is the same as when I first met you this year.
I am accomplishing all my goals.
"
"Thank you _____ for the update. 
Have you had a chance to see your physician in 2013 for an annual physical and to discuss your cholesterol?
Thanks, Lori
"
"Hi Lori, I was out on vacation last week and today is the first chance I've had to go through my e-mails completely.  I can say that I'm eating more fruits and vegetables than I was because they're easier to get.  My weight is staying around the same, not gaining or losing (unfortunately).  I had my blood drawn back in June for my thyroid and everything was good except my cholesterol was up some, but my total number was not high.  My family doctor told me he thinks that it's ok.  I'm doing ok on the exercise, it's a struggle for me because I come in really early and I walk and am active all day that when I leave work that I think I just decompress..Well, that's all that I can think of, let me know if you think of anything other questions.

"
"Hi Dawn, 
I was on vacation last week and am going through emails now and responded prior to going through them all.   I just emailed you back from another email.  Just ignore it. You have already updated me.  
So you are compliant and up to date.  
Thanks for the info below.  Maybe with fruits and veggies this summer that cholesterol will start to decrease again!
Have a great week. 
Lori
"
"I have not spoken with you since April and need to get an update on how you are doing.  The last time we spoke, you were walking with your sister and were up to 2 miles per day.  And you felt like you were losing weight since your pants were too large! 
How are things going now with your exercise and your healthy eating?
Thanks, Lori 
  
"
"Hey Lori - Hope you are well. Sorry I didn't respond quicker but we are so busy. 

Unfortunately, my sister isn't able to walk right now due to complications from cancer.  While I'm not walking as much, I am walking 2 -3 times a week on my 
treadmill  during my favorite tv show and my pants are still too large. In fact, I have a safety pin holding them up now.   

I see my regular dr  today. 
"
"I got your email last Friday and I have been trying to open it.  After I reset my password for the secure emails I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget but it is not letting me log on.  It keeps saying it's incorrect and all my security answers are incorrect as well. 

As for how I'm doing on my goals, not good.  I've gained weight.  I went for my annual women's exam on the 14th and I weighed 276 pounds.  I knew I had gained weight since October's screening but I didn't think it was that much; I was thinking it would be maybe 10 lbs at most.  I hadn't been going to the gym since I moved in April, and even though I would walk through the neighborhood, I should've known that just walking wasn't going to help me lose weight.  I have been eating healthier though and really focusing on my portions.  I keep little baggies full of vegetables and fruit in my fridge so that when I want a snack it's easier to grab those. 

I started back at the gym yesterday.  I went and did a cardio routine on the elliptical.  I'm sore today but I don't want that to discourage me from going again tonight.  I'm hoping I can get back in the habit of doing some form of exercise everyday so that I can get back to losing weight.   

"
"So glad that you are back on track with the gym!  That is awesome and you will be able to notice a difference if you can stick with it!
You know what works well for you to lose weight.  The healthy diet and exercise will get you there-slowly but surely-and you will feel so good about getting it done. 
Keep up the good work and hang in there!
Lori
"
"I am doing fine, how are you?  I now weigh approximately 140 pounds.  I am still working with the pigs daily and have a garden.  Trying to eat more vegetables.  I'm drinking water but still need to increase my daily intake.
Sweet tooth still there but working on it.

Have a wonderful day.
"
"Thank you for the update. Glad you are doing well.
That is everything I need other than one question.
Have you had a chance to have an annual physical and mammogram this year?
Thanks, Lori
"
"Hi Lori,

My physical is scheduled for 7/17/2013.  I haven't had the mammogram they'll probably have it scheduled when I go for physical.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Have a wonderful day.

"
"I am trying really hard to eat healthy everyday.

I am still having to spend alot of my time caring for my Mother.

Exercise has been, very little,  I do try to get a walk in some times.

I hope you have a good 4th.

Thanks,  Joan

"Thank you for the update Joan.
I was at the beach for July 4 so it was great!
I am glad to see that your weight and BP are stable. I know you are super busy with work and taking care of your mother.
Our next class at Strickland will be 7/23/13 on pre-diabetes.  Hope to see you then.

"I have been doing well. Still running 3-4 times a week if not more. Weight hasn't really changed. Still trying to stick to the healthier snacks - fruits, veggies and almonds. 

Hope you are doing well also. 
"
"Thanks for the update ____.  Glad you are doing well and still exercising and eating healthy.  
Just a reminder that your annual physical and pap smear was in May 2012. Have you had an appt yet this year?
Thanks and looking forward to seeing you in July at the next class or in October at the next screening .
Have a great summer. Lori
"
Yes I had my annual physical in May and all was good
"Finally made it to a follow up doctor's appt yesterday and wanted to update you as you had requested :-) 

Weight was up a tad....153 lbs  I think......need to work on getting that back to at least the 140's 

BP was 124/72 

A1C was 5.7 

Thanks and have a good day!

"Your HgbA1c is back down to your 2011 value so that is great!  
Your BP is good.  
So you are doing well
Keep up the good work and enjoy the rest of your summer.

"Hello Kim, 

I do not have a very good update for you.  I have fallen off the wagon and gained a few pounds.  I don't really have any excuses, other than I am just tiered of trying.  I am not stuffing my face by no means, but have not drank enough water and not eating the best foods either.  I have an outing August first, so I have decided to try to loose a few pounds before that so that I do not have to buy any more clothes. That is my new goal. 

Talk to you soon. 
"
"Veronica,
Sorry for the delayed response. 
Sorry that you fell off the wagon. Hope you are back on again. You are worth it girl. You can do it!
Try adding lemon or lime or even cucumber to your water. You can take a few slices to work in a lunch box or fix your water before you leave home and just keep adding ice and water all day. 
You were only a few pounds short of returning to your pre-pregnancy wt. 
What is your current wt? 
Are you still doing boot camp or walking?
Let me hear from you regarding the questions above (I underlined for ease.)
Then I?ll see you at the KYN screening in Sept.
We will start over fresh again.  ;o)
Are you using the ?tips? sheet?
Let me know how I can help you.

I wanted to e mail you now because I am going on vacation the last of this month and I was scared I would forget to report to you. Here is my cholesterol numbers done on May 15, 2013. My current weight is 140. Doing alot of yard work and push mowing! 
"
Wow! That?s awesome ..........! You were able to reduce your total chol by  62 points AND its down to NORMAL. Woohoo! Great job! Besides taking your medication for it, what have you been doing to get it down?  Your LDL came down quite a bit too. 
Congratulations! You have obtained your health goal for Soaring to Health!!! What would you like to make your next health goal (from now until the next KYN screening in Oct)? To maintain your chol/BP/wt WNL (within normal limits)? Let me know. Good job on exercising and mowing with a push mower. Incredible woman! 
  
Have you had any medication changes? 
  
Send me your next update by the end of Aug. When you update me, let me know if you received your annual mammogram in Aug too. 
Thanks so much for sending this good news! Made my day. I?m so proud of you! 
Warm Regards,

Just reporting in for the month. Current weight is 139. I am still very active at night, yard work push mowing etc.... I will start back walking up here everyday as soon as it cools off some. But I do walk my dog everyday. 
"Yes I did report to you on Aug 8. This has happened to me more than once. I e mail you and then you say you have not heard from me. I will be glad to send you the e mail again. 

Current weight is 138. Still active, walking, yard work etc....doing the best I can with back &amp; neck problems that you are aware of. I sent you my cholesterol #'s when I had it checked last time.

"My apologies ?again?!
We have a new computer system to document in, so I?ve been catching up on my email documentation from July &amp; Aug. It?s not been a nightmare, but obviously my system to handle it is imperfect. I have your update from 8/8/2013. Once I received this email I was able to format my email ?from? &amp; found it. That was just a couple of weeks ago. Don?t know how I missed it scrolling down thru them. That?s why I prefaced to please forgive me if I?m wrong. 
Congrats on the wt loss since last KYN. 

Have you made your mammogram appt?
What is your doctor?s plan for your herniated bulging discs?

I look forward to seeing you on the 24th.

"I am going to get an allergy shot tomorrow so I will ask my doc to see if I can get a test now if that would make sense. 

Also my wife is having issues with her wrist. Started with our oldest son and how she held him when she nursed. I will remind her to talk to you about it to see if her issues are similar to yours. She has seen several doctors who have not been able to help her. 

Glad your daughter is home safely. 

Take care.

She has been to see her MD, her a1c was 10.  She has been walking in her neighborhood several times a week, and has lost ten pounds.  Her MD was pleased that she is exercising, and has lost weight.  She is having an issue with her diabetes medication, in that it seems to be the one that really works for her, but isn't covered by insurance- her MD is working on trying to find something that will work.  Encouraged her to contact her COMPASS Health Pro and see if they may offer any assistance with this, gave member the phone number.  Congratulated her on her efforts to increase her exercise and on her weight loss.  She did receive the information I sent and has been reading it a little each night, she is finding it helpful, thanked me for helping her.  She is going through a stressful time because she recently had to place her father in a rehab center.  Encouraged her to take as good care of herself as possible so she is better available to help her Dad.  She sees her MD again in November and will let me know how that visit goes.

I apologize, I had written down that I would just see you when you guys came to our office in September. I apologize, I must have written down inaccurate information. 

Update is that I have had a tough few months. Went to Atlanta for training and really didn't do much physically. 

Still eating whole grain foods and healthier foods. Working on portion quantity and how much I eat. 

Currently weight appx 240 lbs. 

Just started getting up prior to work and have been walk/running with my dog for about 30 minutes to an hour. Plan on continuing to do this. Starts my day off a lot better. 

Thanks 
"
"Hey .....,
Good job jumping into walking/running with your dog. Getting up early and working out before work takes a lot of discipline. Good job!!!
The important thing is to ?DO?. Do little things all day long to increase your calorie burn and decrease your calorie uptake. 
You and I definitely need more detailed goals and action plans this coming year. I feel I have failed you some how. You gained 10# during the last quarter of last year. Another 5# by May of this yr. 
Are you drinking calories (drinks that contain sugar)?  Are you using your ?stepper?? I know its been a stressful year in some ways. I will help you all I can. Let?s talk on the phone after we get your KYN results back and see how we can make this next benefit year workout better for you. Sound good?  Be thinking of ideas of what you are willing to do. I?ll have several ideas too. 
See you on the 24th. 
Thanks,
Kim
"
Hi Kim. I hope that you are doing well. I had lost another pound but then gained back two. I &quot;fell off the wagon&quot; a couple of weekends ago but I am back on track again. I'm walking a mile  in the evenings and doing 70 or more sit ups daily as well. My right knee is having problems so I'm using the elliptical until it feels better. I'm not  in the bad snacking mode just eating fruit or low carb, low calorie protein bar and protein shake for lunch and normal portion size &amp; healthy dinner. Please let me know if you need anything else. Thank you 
"Thanks.
See you on the 24th.
Kim
"
"No change,

Still playing golf and watching my diet - weight is still the same. Blood pressure was taken yesterday 112 over 78

Have a great week end.
"
"Good deal. Great BP!
I hope to see you Sept 24th at the KYN screening.
"
"Hi, Kim. Thanks so much for your email and attachments. Very helpful!
 
The new medicine I'm taking (once a day) is called &quot;Metoprolol 50 MG ER&quot; and 
everything seems to be going ok.  I started it mid-June.  
 
Thanks again. See ya in Sept. 
"
"Morning Kim, 

I wasn't at the office when y'all did the pre-diabetes presentation, but did review the course material, and my quiz is attached. 

It's been a very rough couple of months.  You already know that my dad was in the hopsital in April for pneumonia.  He became very ill again in June, went back to the hospital on 6/4, and passed away on 7/22 at age 82.   

I had a physical scheduled in July that I had to cancel, but I'll reschedule and will let you know how it goes.  As you can probably guess, my diet &amp; exercise regimens haven't been all they should be lately, but now the &quot;dust is settling&quot; so I'll work at getting back on track. 

Hope you're doing well, Kim. 

Thanks, 
"
"Wow .... I did not know your dad passed. I?m so very sorry! I pray God will comfort you. 
One thing that helped me when my dad died was just being prepared for the crazy things that would trigger grief. 
A friend of mine had lost her dad and warned me. It?s kind of like a wave at the ocean. 
You turn your back to walk out of the ocean and a wave sneaks up from behind and wham! It hits you. 
That?s kind of how grief is when you?ve lost someone close and dear to your heart. 
You may be in the grocery store or Walmart and see his favorite cookies and just lose it right there. 
Know that that is normal first of all. Secondly, allow yourself to cry and grieve in a healthy way.(Don?t run from it or push it down. Let it come up.) 
I highly recommend the #1 tip for grieving: Give each feeling to Jesus, verbally, out loud. 
Allow Him to hold you &amp; comfort you. Ask Him what He has for you in place of the feeling you just gave Him. Wait. Listen. Receive. 
I will be praying for you. 
  
Oh, Please remind ........... to get me 2 quizzes. I don?t see where he has attended any classes or sent me the make up quizzes. 
Thanks, 
Kim 
"
"Thanks very much for the kind words and good advice.  You're so right about crazy triggers. 

............. is doing the pre-diabetes class &amp; quiz, and should be sending the quiz to you.  Will there be another class he can do before the end of plan year?  Or does he need to do one of the older ones? 

Thanks again, 
"
"I received the same email 3 times. Just FYI. You have completed your requirements for the Soaring to Health program. I hope to see you at the KYN screening in Sept. Please say hello, tell me your name (remind me who you are) and I will give you a hug. 
Kim
"
"You are very welcome.

............. will need to view an old class pp &amp; send me the quiz. 
He can obtain those from Yolanda in HR or you can get them and forward to him. 
There will be no other classes for this wellness program (Soaring to Health) year (which goes from Oct-Sept). 
I hope to see you both for the KYN screening Sept 24th. Remember to fast everything except medications and water (drink lots of water).
Take care of yourself.
Kim
"
"Good to hear from you.
What steps have you taken to find a doctor?
Sorry, you must be progressing toward your goal to be compliant with the program.
?	Have you asked around (neighbors, family, friends, coworkers, church buddies)?
?	If so, have you called to see if a particular MD is in network?
?	Have you called their office to see if the MD is taking new patients?
These are steps to ?finding a doctor?. Please take one.  ;o) You are WORTH it!!!
"
"THIS IS WHO I GO TO IF I NEED A DOCTOR, WHO I HAVE BEEN GOING TO FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR WITH BETTER OFFICE HOURS AND ONE WHO I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH, BUT I  HAVE NOT HAD OR MADE TIME TO INVESTIGATE NEW DOCTORS. MY OLD FAMILY DOCTOR WHO I WENT TO FROM BIRTH RETIRED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND EASTERN MEDICAL ASSOCIATES TOOK OVER HIS PRACTICE. 
EASTERN MEDICAL ASSOCIATES HAS ALL MY RECORDS FROM BIRTH AND THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. WHEN I SAID I WAS TRYING TO FIND A DOCTOR, I MEANT THAT I WAS TRYING TO FIND A DOCTOR I LIKE. 

THIS IS HER CONTACT INFO! 

............................, MD 
Family Medicine 
Eastern Medical Associates 
4680 US Highway 117 N
Pikeville, NC 27863 
(919) 242-5271 
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS! 
THANKS! 
"
"My apologies if I offended you in some way. Sending a message in all capital letters per email etiquette means you are ?screaming? those words. My request for you to take a step to progress towards your goal, was simply meant to encourage you &amp; to keep you (on track &amp;) from becoming non-compliant or complacent with that particular health goal. If you want to continue to use an urgent care physician, that is a choice you are free to make. I?m not sure that an urgent care physician will be able to perform an annual ?Physical Exam?. Feel free to contact his/her office and ask. Your goal included ?finding a MD &amp; making an appt for a PE?. This is basic preventive care. These are all the reasons that I followed up with you regarding finding a PCP. It is great that you are continuing to exercise and eat healthy. Congrats on the few pounds which you lost. You are doing a great job of creating healthy habits at a young age. Prevention is key. 
  
Please let me know how you would like to move forward with your goals (keep them, change them, etc.). I want you to choose a goal that you want to reach and makes you feel comfortable. A goal should be measurable, something you desire to do and obtainable (realistic). 
  
I have your current goals listed as: 
1.       Lose 10# of wt 
2.       Find MD &amp; make appt for a PE 
I have your action plans (how to obtain your goals) listed as: 
1.       Exercise: gym &amp; run 2 miles, cardio &amp; wts; 2x/week, then 3x/week then in March 6x/week (impressive!) 
2.       Eat healthy: increase fruits &amp; veg;  decrease red meat &amp; dairy; switch from white to brown (starches/carbs) 
3.       Ask about MD; check to see if ?in network?; check to see if MD is taking new pts.; make appt; keep appt. 
  
Please reply to this email and then send your next update by the end of Aug. 
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you. 
Warm Regards, 
Kim 
"
"Kim, 
I apologize if I offended you in my email, It was in all caps because all the work I do, I have to type it in all caps and I never took my keyboard off all caps. I apologize. As for Eastern Medical, It is not an Urgent care facility, It is a family medical practice. 
I will continue to reach my goals, and I will start the process in finding a doctor I like. 
Again I apologize! 
Have a good day! 
Thanks Again! 
"
"Thanks for the clarification. Apology accepted. 
My bad. I misunderstood on the MD being an urgent care. 
I?m going to remove your goal to obtain a different MD, since you do have one. 
Feel free to obtain a different MD any time, but I won?t keep it as a goal for our program, so it won?t be counted against you if you don?t switch. I?ll just make that a side note instead of a goal. 
I was looking at this goal as a person who didn?t have a MD at all. Sorry. I?m clear now. Thanks for extending grace. I apologize for misunderstanding. 
I?ll keep your goal to lose the few more pounds.
Sorry to take more of your time this morning.
I look forward to hearing from you in Aug.
Enjoy your day.
Kim
"
"Hey .............,
I received your quiz, but didn?t receive an update from you for Aug.
?	What?s your latest BP?
?	Still hitting the YMCA gym?
?	How?s the healthy eating?
Thanks,

"Hey young lady,
Sorry to hear you were removed from the benefit plan at SIG.
Just reminds me to pray for you.
God will provide.
He is faithful.
You are a rare beauty &amp; precious to our Papa God and me!
Call me if you want to keep in touch or just would like someone who understands (who has been thru similar circumstances) to pray for you, even at 2am. Mean it.
Hugs to you!

Congenital hyperinsulinism is chronic continuous and moderately severe condition that is clinically stable a\\\\nddn involves endocrine system. Glucose varies between 80 to 120. Mother checking several times daily.  Diazoxide requires intensive monitoring to prevent toxicity such as hyper or hypoglycemic states. However, with compliance, risk factors are greatly reduced.  
Went over results.

"I just spoke with Anna Scott of Coastal GA and she states that her husband Walter Scott  ID# 6320000016 will begin renal dialysis as early as next week. He had his AV fistula placed on July and will begin dialysis soon.  
The plan is for him to go to Devita Dialysis Center in Darien GA on Monday-Wednesday and  Friday for dialysis. 
Anna states she does not know if Cigna is aware and is not sure about network or precert requirements. 
I have him on active case management but wanted to  be sure Paragon was aware.  
Is Devita in network for Cigna?  Does renal dialysis need precert through Cigna?  
Are you aware of his status with Medicare since he is an end stage renal disease patient?
Please let me know if anyone else at Paragon should be added to this email notification.  
Thank you so much. Lori

Met to go over blood results.  He said at that time he was doing a certain diet, which included lots of eggs.  He has never had any issues with his CHOL before.  Bikes 150 miles a week.  Feels he is a healthy individual.  No additional questions. 
Went over results.  
"Kim, 

I just went to my physician.  My BP was 125/75.  My weight was 220.  We have been eating at home a lot more and eating less red meat.  Getting my daughter to try different foods too.  More vegetables and fruits. 

I am exercising 3-4 times a week and it will go up now that softball season has begun and I am coaching again.  I pitch to the girls about 200-250 fast pitches 3 times a week in addition to my work outs in the work out room at the office. 

Please find my two quizzes attached. 
"
"Yay! You just made my job much easier. Both quizzes AND an update in ONE email.  Woohoo! ;o)
I know you are far away. 
We will talk after your KYN results return and see how we can?t make t his year go a little smoother for you.
You should be getting your self report packet in the 1st 2 weeks of Sept.
Thanks,
Kim

"Hey Kim, 

I believe I was on the list to update you end of August.   

I would say since last time we spoke, I have maintained.  Haven't really put on any more mass.  Maybe lost a few pounds.  Currently around 175.  Did a little bit of swimming this summer, but not as much lap swimming as I would have liked.   

Exercise has mainly been riding the bike for 10-20 minutes a few times a week, and very scattered weight lifting.  Some weeks I'll lift 3-4 days, others I won't lift at all. 

Hate to admit it, but I know my eating habits have slipped a bit.  Would really like to start cooking meals again and planning meals a week ahead.   

Currently taking my protein shake/weight gainer. (MHP &quot;up your mass&quot;).  800ish calories?  62g protein.  Bunch of BCAA's.  I feel like that, mixed with better eating habits, I'll be able to pack on some weight, and keep bodyfat % low. 

See you next month! 
"
"Great update.
Thanks.

"Hi Kim,

This is Robin Stratton, wife of Chris Stratton, Strickland Employee.  I hope you are doing well.  I am checking in with you.  I am maintaining my weight.  I continue to  exercise 3 days week by walking two miles and I go to a power cut class one time a week.   I am getting back on a healthier eating schedule now that summer is over.

Please let  me know if there's anything else I need to do to be compliant and if you could confirm receipt so that I'll know you received.  Thanks and have a great day!

Hi Kim-sorry about that, I have been out of business.  Yes, I have been continuing my exercise regimen, which consists of daily walk, of 1-2 miles, gym 3-5 times per week which consists of treadmill for 2 miles and weight training, and I bike approx 10 miles once per week.  I was able to hike up Mt Chocorua in Nh this summer, which was an approx 5 mile hike.  I will also be doing some hiking and boating this weekend.  I continue to watch my diet and have tried to increase fruit and vegetable intake and reduce carbs.  My BP is fine.  I am scheduling a physical with my physician for next month, so if you could let me know what blood work I need done so that I can have that available for you.  Thanks.   
"
"Great update ....... Thanks.
The blood work we need for the KYN screening (Sept 24th) is:
?	Hemoglobin A1c
?	Fasting Blood sugar
?	Lipid panel (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides)
?	Possibly a ?PSA? (I haven?t heard the final word on this)
You should be able to receive a copy of your blood work within 2 days of your appt with your doctor. You will have to ask them for it (mail it, fax it, you pick it up from their office or if you have a ?portal? with them then you could print it). Just make sure you have a hard copy of all the above. I look forward to seeing you at the screening. 
Thanks,
Kim

"Hi Kim, 

I'm not sure if I owe you an update or not.  To be honest, most of this year has been real difficult, and everything kind of blurs together.   

As you know, my dad was ill/in the hospital during the first quarter of the year, and then was in the hospital for all of June &amp; July, until he passed away.  This past month has been filled with things nobody wants to deal with ---- funeral, lawyers, will, medical bills, clearing out a house that my parents lived in for 50 years (not sure we'll ever get throught with that).....and just plain grieving. 

I sure can't say my diet or my exercise has been good lately, but I will get back on track, and also make an appt for a physical.  I still am drinking a lot more water, so at least that's one good thing.   

Hope you have a wonderful Labor Day weekend.

"Hey Eric,

This is a  friendly follow up on your Know Your Numbers Health Screening. 

Just wanted to follow up with you about your blood pressure.  Your blood pressure was elevated at the Know Your Numbers Health Screening.  I encourage you strongly to make an appointment to follow up with your doctor concerning your blood pressure.  Monitoring your blood pressure several times a week can give you a good idea what your pressure normally runs.  Normal blood pressure ranges 120/80 or lower.  

Please review your Know Your Numbers packet we sent you in the mail.  I don?t know if you have been treated for high blood pressure by your doctor because the portion of the  questionnaire is missing that information.  If you are on blood pressure medication it is important that you follow up with your doctor so that he can possibly make necessary adjustments to your medication.  If you are not being followed by a doctor for your blood pressure it is important that you do so.  

Blood pressure directly impacts heart disease.  Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and in many cases simple lifestyle modifications can help you improve your overall health and reduce your risk for heart disease.

Your health is important to us we want you to be the BEST you can be!
Please contact me at the numbers or email below if you have any questions. I will be glad to help you with any health questions you may have.  

Thank you

"I'm really very sorry that I was late on this.  As for my goals, I did not have a very good month.  We went on vacation and I totally got back into unhealthy habits.  ........... (work buddy) and I have  a pact that we are going to do this together now, so I think it will help to have an accountability buddy. However, even though I haven't been eating very well, I have exercised 11 out of the last 12 days. I have been doing it in the morning instead of waiting until the evening, and I think that has helped.  When I try to make myself exercise at night, I usually talk myself out of it because I'm pooped.

Good job on packing your lunch.
I know that takes time & effort, but it can make ALL the difference.
If you get tired of plain water, add slices of lemon or lime to it.
The best way to get more exercise in, is to put it on your schedule/calendar.
Plan ahead. You are worth it!
Cooler temps are ahead.
Enjoy the fall.
When you come in for the KYN screening please find me and say hello so I can put your name with your face.
Remember to drink lots of water and take your normal medications, but fast otherwise.

Went over results. 
Met to do TOB #1.  He is a chewer.  1 can last about a week.  He said he does not do anything else bad for him so chewing to him is one thing he lets himself do.  He knows he needs to quit, but right now he is not sure if he wants to.  Considering doing the nicotine gum as a replacement.  Needs a PCP.  Going to call me when he finds time.  Works two jobs

"Hey .......,
Thanks for taking a few minutes to speak with me regarding your KYN results and health.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
The best time to reach me by phone is 9a-4p and my contact info is below. 
I?m sorry for the life changing event you experienced last year. I pray that you are healing and recovering well; that God blesses you and you do well going forward. Sounds like you are on the right track. I?m here to help you. So please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you further. 

I hope you find the attachments above helpful.
Here is the scoop:
?	?tips? = the bullets I told you about. Add one/week or one/month however fast or slow you?d like to change your lifestyle
?	Glycemic index (GI) = a list of the GI of fruits. The higher the #, the faster that food puts sugar in your blood. So you want to eat the fruits with the lowest GI (white and green shaded) the most often, & try to avoid the high GI fruits (yellow & red shaded).
?	Fav recipes = Just that. Some ideas of how to eat healthy
?	All about carb counting. Not asking you to ?count carbs?. Just a sheet with good info on starchy foods. Main thing is not to eat too big of a portion. Most starchy veg/foods are � cup = 1 serving.

Warm Regards,
"
Met to do TOB #3.  He said he has a chew with his morning coffee, after his workout, lunch and dinner, and at night before bed.  He said he has cut the amount of chews in half it that has seemed like a lot for him right now.  He wants to stay consistent right now with only 4-5 a day.

Good job already making changes. Remember when you see your MD in 2 weeks, to take your KYN packet with you to review. 
I hope sparkpeople helps you to lose the weight you want to lose. It?s a great website. It only takes a few minutes/day to track your nutrition. You are worth it!

I?m your health coach. I do this for a living, but I also live it.
I lost 36# in 2010 and have kept it off. It?s mostly a balance between calories in (what we eat/drink) and calories out (exercise to burn calories).

TOB #1
Have tried cholesterol medicine in the past and had such horrible reactions(stiff,achy muscles) that I am trying to get it down through diet and exercise.  Please give me a chance this way.  By the way, a doctor a long time ago told he as long as LDL was half of HDL(may have the 2 confused), that the total number didn't matter as long as it was half or more.  I'll google that and find out if you don't have that information.
Met to do TOB #6.  She said her and her husband have decided the other day this needs to happen.  Starting chantix at the end of Oct.  Finished the program.  Very satisfied with the program.  
TOB #6
"Linda, 

Your total Cholesterol is 240
Your Good Cholesterol is suppose to be greater than 39 yours is 72. That is Good!
Your Bad Cholesterol is 152 it is suppose to be less than 99. OH No!  IF WOULD LOWER THIS NUMBER IT WOULD LOWER THE TOTAL CHOLESTEROL.
Your Triglycerides are 80 and they are suppose to be less than 149. That is Good! 

Diet and Exercise can change these numbers.  

Check with your doctor.  He/She may want you to try some meds or he/she may not.   Their are a few like Zetia that dont have those side effects.  I know what you are talking about.  

Just don't ignore it.

Member called to review biometric screening results.  He has been diabetic for a couple years.  He has regular diabetic eye and foot exams.  He recently suffered from carbon dioxide poisoning, about the time his labs were drawn, and said it had affected all his lab values- that his bp is normally 120/80.  His normal a1c averages about 7- it had gotten up to 9 though with the recent tax season (he is an accountant, was working a lot and not taking care of himself). He does walk a mile daily, his goal for the year is to increase the distance and speed, with the ultimate GOAL of losing 25 pounds.  He eats heart healthy.  He is on Lipitor and metformin.  His mother has always had high triglycerides also.  He is motivated to prevent diabetic complications.  
rings - no answer then 'disconnected' -- Re-entered some of assessment from notes.

poor connection - makes conversation very difficult - denies depression, unable to give lab/bp values - just states, &quot; they're good&quot; - states bg's 119-130's.  Kidney infection resolving resolves kidney issues - he states.  Unable to confirm as he doesn't know name/phone number of his MD.
He has started PT for HEP - pos reinforcement.  Not tracking daily wts or bg - re-teaching with emphasis on how this will benefit him; focus on danger s/s - good retention there -- and how these tools will help him spot danger before he gets into trouble.  He has had  other HSB RN CM's call - teaching re general CM and Renalogic-HSB CM, how kidneys are affected by pathophys at play: DM and CV.  He tends to snack also -- teaching re DM diet, healthy snacking; opportunities for activity vs snacking and danger s/s that desire to snack may indicate hi/low bg.  - He is receptive to teaching - states he will start tracking and verbalizes understanding of teaching.   Obtained PCP and nephrologist #'s - will request records Monday

"Mr. Massoud, 

Just wanted to let you know a few of your labs from the Know Your Number results were elevated. I will go ahead and fax them to your doctor.  The labs are elevated but it may be because of one of your diagnosis? they may be fine for you and your doctor .

I got your eye exam results.  Thank you.  

Have you had a colonoscopy?  If so, can you find out what YEAR?  If you have not had one or it has been over 10 years ago you need one. 

Please email me the receipt from the next visit to your Primary Care Physician so that  I can mark you as compliant with the CAPE wellness program.

REMINDER:  If you are married you will need for your spouse to send her info as well.  Couples have to both be compliant so that you can get the discount.

Agrees to walk 10-15 min 5d/week to start.  Discussed placing his exercise on his calendar. Agreed to receive educational sheets via email. Pleasant. "
"Thanks for taking time to return my call this afternoon. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
I hope you find the attachments helpful. Please feel free to contact me as often as you would like for health coaching, questions, etc. 
Let me know when you make your MD appt, the date. If you don?t have your KYN packet/results by the day before your appt., please notify me by phone and we can fax your results to your MD?s office. Just have your MD?s ph & fax #s available. 
You are making good choices by starting to decrease if not cut out sodas and sweet tea and increase your exercise. 
Using your treadmill, trampoline or walking for 10-15 min. 5 days/week will burn numerous calories.
Guard against the thought that ?now I can have a treat?. 
The point of exercising is to burn more calories than you eat until you weigh whatever your and your doctor?s goal is. 
If you cut down on calories AND burn more through exercise, you will lose weight faster. 

I?ve included some of my favorite healthy recipes.
The ?All about carb counting? is a guideline to carbohydrates and how to recognize them and cut down on your intake. 
Most ?carbs? (starchy foods like corn, potatoes, rice, pasta) are measured at a � cup being one serving.
Fresh whole fruits have carbs, but they also have lots of fiber, so eat at least 3 of those/day. They are great treats/desserts because they taste sweet. 

The ?Tips for a Healthier You? are bullets of ideas/steps to apply to your lifestyle. 
I recommend members print it; read over it; place today?s date beside any bullet you are already doing; and then add one per week or per month, however fast or slow you want to change. 
I?ve been on this journey to a healthier lifestyle. I lost 36# in 2010 and have kept it off. You can do this. You are worth it!
Let me know how I can help you.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Warm Regards,

Good morning!
Thank you, I have corrected your address in our system.  I hope you are doing well.
How is the nutrasystem coming along?  I know some ladies who have done very well with it.

Her GOAL for the year is to get back to exercising regularly and to change some of her snacking habits- eat more carrots and celery and less cookies and chips.  We discussed the benefits of exercise with regard to bp as well.  She has received the educational materials we sent and has been looking over them.  Encouraged her to contact me with any questions she may have.

Member states she has been using whole milk the past nine months and her cholesterol has become elevated in the past when she used whole milk.  In the past she cut her dairy use and used one percent milk and her cholesterol went down to normal levels-  she plans to go back to using one percent milk.  Discussed the benefits of exercise in helping reduce cholesterol- she plays volleyball, bikes, ziplines- encouraged aerobic exercise.  When she received her results from the KYN screening, she realized she needed to get back to some healthier habits and has purchased an exercise video to help her reach this goal.  Her GOAL is to exercise 30 minutes a day.  She is excited about her upcoming move and the freedom she will have from yardwork --she will have more time for exercise and outdoor activities.  She doesn't take bp medication.  Encouraged her to check her bp and keep a record of it, share this information with her MD when she goes to review the KYN results with him (she will be finding a new MD in her new hometown).

I am writing to you in response to your call and email. I am sorry I missed your call, that number you reached me at was actually my mothers home. I can be reached at 856-506-4988 at your convenience.
In regard to my numbers I did tell the healthcare specialist I did not fast on that day because of a deadline I had to meet. Being that I work Monday through Friday and could not make it on time to do the blood work I had to do it last minute and maybe that is why my numbers were higher than usual. Feel free to contact me at anytime.

He has a return appt with his MD in Oct.  He will be having a colonoscopy in October, as he is 53 and knows he needs to have one.  He is concerned because his bowel habits have changed, and his mother has a history of colon CA. 
He is not happy that he has not been able to lose weight since he stopped smoking- he isn't walking as much because of arthritis in his lower back.  The weight issue is embarrassing to him.  
His goal is to lose some weight, he just isn't sure how to make that happen at this point- he is eating heart healthy, lots of salad, vegetables, lean meats, low carb.  Encouraged him to talk with his MD about his concerns.  
He does feel good that he hasn't smoked in 23 weeks --congratulated him on this great accomplishment!

I looked over your Know Your Numbers Questionnaire and Lab results.  
I see you are missing the urine nicotine test and a Hemoglobin A1C blood test.  Please go by K Smothers office  and get a lab form with these two test marked.
Just email me when you have these test done so I can watch for the results.  

REMEMBER:  In order to get the discount on your insurance you need these two test completed AND a physical. 
 When you get your physical please  scan and email me the receipt or something from the office that shows you have been there.  

If you have a spouse they must also complete the following 3 steps

Will plan on proceeding with autologous transplant for his diagnosis of multiple myeloma if his PET shows no evidence of involvement. Jackie with AIG is already following. Will follow up. 
INTAKE:  Betty's med records were reviewed, which showed a visit to her NP who documented no kidney disease, despite showing a Creatinine of 0.9, which gives us a eGFR of 63 = stage 2 kidney disease.  RN did teach that despite a nml creatinine, when we account for age, it shows us that she does indeed have some type of kidney disease per the NKF guidlines, as RN is not qualified to diagnose, she is encouraged to ask her NP re her GFR.  She verbalizes a lack of knowledge re self care, danger s/s, diet, meds and lacks motivation to participate - though does agree to track bg's for 1-2 wks (which she has not been doing - AIC was 6.7 ) and agrees to allow RN to c/b.

On June 27, creat was 0.9 (GFR of 64; lab's is 67.7). - which would put her in stage 2.   Needs teaching and RN will review with RN at her D.O's office next wk when office open.
INTAKE: David reports his eGFR at MD appt was 60.  Teaching re stage of CKD, risk factors and pathophys.  He does not always ck bg's, nor does he ck bp's.  Teaching re tracking and interventions to reduce risk to progressive CKD.  He is very receptive to teaching.  Assists in developing POC.  Will start tracking.  Draft letter, send ed material.

TOB #5
Member is a nurse, she works twelve hour shifts.  She was dx with fibromyalgia approx 8 yrs ago.  She did see her MD to review her biometric screening results. MD started her on simvastatin for elevated lipids.  We discussed diet changes and exercise to help in reducing lipids. With her work schedule, and the fibromyalgia, she doesn't have much energy for exercise.  Encouraged her to consider creative ways to increase her activity- when watching TV, maybe get up and walk in place for five minutes at the time- this would be better than nothing, and starting small would help make this goal more attainable.  She felt she might be able to do this, start slowly and increase with time.  She does have a family history of diabetes.  Her blood sugar at screening was 121- she reports that she was not fasting though.  Encouraged her to ask MD about checking her A1c when she returns next month for lipid panel.

Please see Nadia she has the lab forms get two one for your wife and one for yourself.  You ONLY need the URINE NICOTINE.  IF they ask for blood the form is marked incorrectly.  Mark out everything but URINE NICOTINE.   You should only give Labcorp a urine sample for them to run.

You are right. Your doctors office is correct.  It is one year and a day before you can get another physical. 

 I have talked with Kathy on the phone.  You were compliant last go round with your physical on Nov 30 2012.  So get your physical in Dec and send me the receipt and all will be good.

Have you sent in your KYN Questionnaire and done your lab work yet?

"Hi Aileen

I had my last physical on 11/30/2012 for the 2013 insurance year. I just called to schedule my appointment for a physical on Oct 17th to make sure I meet the Oct 31s deadline. My doctor?s office told me that my insurance will only pay for a physical once a year and so they will not cover me for another physical until after Nov 30th which is obviously past the Oct 31st deadline. Is this the case, and if so, what do you suggest that I do?

Thanks!

"Talked with member, reviewed KYN results.  She has not yet seen her MD to review results.  States she takes amlodipine 5mg and metoprolol 50 mg daily for bp.  She does not have a bp cuff at home but can have it checked at work.  She has not had it rechecked since the screening, when it was 132/110- she states she was in a hurry that day and that her bp isn't normally that high.  Advised her to see her MD asap to have it rechecked.  She is not experiencing headache/dizziness/blurred vision, weakness, states she feels &quot;fine&quot;.  
She does not have a family history of diabetes.  Discussed her a1c being 5.7, and reviewed diet changes and exercise habits that can help reduce the a1c.  She occasionally drinks a soda- encouraged her to use diet drinks or just drink water, and to limit fruit juices. Use unsweetened tea, or use an artificial sweetener in her tea.  She doesn't eat sweets very often.  Encouraged her to change from white bread/rice/pasta to whole grain products.  She stated she eats lots of vegetables.  Her GOAL is to start walking for exercise, at least 2-3 times per week for 20  minutes at a time.  "

"I started a new workout last week and when I finished Tuesday, I felt odd and checked my bp and it was 100/65.  I checked it 10-15 minutes after workout.  Heart rate was 102.  Kind of low bp for someone not in good shape.  Could it have been a little dehydration, blood sugar or something else.  It was the same feeling in the past when my blood pressure was low when I was coming off my BP medicine. When I drank some Gatorade, I was fine.  Going back again today, but placing Gatorade in the car for as soon as I finish. 

Just thought I would check for ideas.  I did not eat anything before going, but I do drink water 30 minutes prior to workout. 

Thanks, 
"
Screened member on 09/24/2013. Discussed member's concern when he worked out last  week and felt his BP drop. Discussed hydration and to make sure he was taking in enough protein and carbs for a workout. Member stated he called this nurse and left a message, but upon my return to the office I found an email instead. 
Kathy gained 2lbs.  Back up to 189.  She said she went to Frenchlick this weekend for two days.  She said she did a lot of walking.  Still doing a lot of walking around the track.  Usually 1.5 miles.  Eating is still going well. 
Weight Management
2nd message
Met to do DOB #6.  She said she has increased her exercise to 4x/week.  She said she has lost about .5lb since the last meeting.  Eating pretty well majority of the days.  She is eating more at home.  Trying to stay away from eating out.  BS was 91 today.  Going on vacation for 2 weeks.  Talked about planning out all of her meals before she leaves.  
DOB #6
"Hey ......,
It was good to see you yesterday. I didn?t find a voice mail on my phone, but did find this email sent on the 13th. I was out of the country all last week. Sorry I wasn?t able to get back with you sooner. Just to recap our conversation yesterday, definitely make sure you are well hydrated before, during and after your workout. It?s rare that someone eats so healthy that they need Gatorade. With today?s food industry habits, they add so much salt to all the processed foods available. The main thing in Gatorade that helps keep folks hydrated is salt. Salt and water have a special relationship. When you take in salt (into your body), your body will ?hold? salt to match it. So. Keep that in mind if you note your BP going up above normal ranges. Just use caution that you don?t swing too far in the other direction. Does this make sense? 
If you have a ability, check your BP before you start exercising. It should be up some, after you exercise. Check it after you exercise too. Let me know what you find (send me the numbers if you can and are willing.) 
If you check your BP before working out and it is normal, then you work out and check it and it is lower AND you are well hydrated, you would want to see your cardiologist before continuing to workout. A normal body response to working out would be for your heart rate AND your BP to go up while exercising and gradually come down to normal once you stopped. 
Keep up the good work!
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kim

Agrees to go to CVS ck. Plans to exercise 3-4x/week. Agrees to check his BP either at CVS or at gym, before and after working out. Pleasant."
"Hey ......,
Thanks for taking my call today and taking time to speak with me.
Good job keeping your MD appt on the 13th.
When is your follow up appt?
I?m sending some attachments to help you regarding your salt/sodium intake. 
These will simply help you be more aware of where salt sneaks into our diet, in ways we sometimes are not aware. 
Reducing sodium/salt in your diet, eating healthy and exercising are ways to reduce your BP naturally.
So its important to keep checking your BP while making lifestyle changes. 

Its great to hear that you are already working out. Great job! 
Remember to check your BP at CVS and/or at the gym before and after your workout sessions and send those to me.
Its important to stay hydrated as well.

I hope the information I?ve provided is helpful to you.
It was a pleasure speaking with you. 
I look forward to hearing from you.
Warm Regards,

LEft message for member to return my call.
"Thanks for taking time to speak with me today. 
Your A1c was 6.7 on 0911/2013. That means your average BS (blood sugar) has been 146 over the last 3 months. A normal BS is between 65-99.

Here are the tips we discussed for you to apply to your lifestyle to help get your BS down to normal:
?	Don?t drink anything with sugar in it (sweet tea/sodas with sugar/juice/beer)
?	Don?t eat sweet treats on an empty stomach
?	Eat every 3-4 hours (some protein & some carbs every time, eating as many greens as you would like ?asparagus, broccoli, greenbeans, spinach, etc.)
?	Be aware of what a serving is for carbs/starchy foods (most of the time its � cup for rice, pasta, potatoes, corn, sweet peas)
See the attachment. The highlighted bullets will help the most to lower your BS

Remember to let me know when your MD appt is and how it goes too.
Warm Regards,

LM on VM.
Sent email on 09/06/2013. Asking member to call this nurse.
Member states she stopped smoking two years ago and has gained weight since then.  She wants to lose weight, and loves to exercise but is extremely tired all the time and doesn't have the energy to exercise very often.  She is planning to return to her MD or to an endocrinologist for an updated evaluation of her thyroid medication which she has been on for many years.  She complains of aching legs, fatigue, daytime sleepiness that is pronounced when she gets still.  We discussed her a1c of 6.2- her sister is diabetic, she is aware of what the labs indicate, and is motivated to reduce her a1c.  Discussed diet changes and exercise as ways to help reduce the a1c.  Elevated cholesterol runs in her family.  She takes medication for her BP.  She does see her MD regularly.  She would like me to follow up with her in three months to check on her progress with exercise/diet changes.  She said she knows what to do, she just hasn't had the energy to do it.  Encouraged her to take one day at a time, write her goal down and put it where she can see it every day-in several places if necessary.  
Member called in response to email sent. Very pleasant. Stated: was in hospital in July with pancreatitis; is seeing endocrinologist & has started insulin; is avoiding alcohol since admit; next appt is 3rd week in Oct; will have blood draw 2nd week of Oct; is seeing a nutritionist regarding diet and is counting carbs and eating low fat. Agrees to send this nurse via email or fax, her lab results in Oct. Very pleasant and proactive.

But I will tell you were in the middle of selling our house and buying a new one. The day I checked it and had blood drawn we were waiting on the results of a home inspection on our house. It was the tenth day of the option period and was in negotiations with the buyer and negotiating our new one.

"Thank you  for taking the time to reply.  My best to you with your new physician.  
There are some simple things you can do to improve your diet and improve your diabetes.  One of the perks of this way of eating is that the food choices also lower cholesterol.  

Fiber is not absorbed by the body.  It is best to choose whole grains as your carbohydrate choices (breads/rolls/rice/crackers).  You will not absorb as much of the food that is whole grain, and your blood sugars are not affected as much as with white bread/white rice/white pasta.  'White' products are usually starchy, and have a definite effect on blood sugar.  An added benefit to whole grains is that they help keep you fuller longer and help with weight loss.

Keeping fiber in mind, fresh fruits and vegetables are a great source of fiber.  They keep you full, provide vitamins and nutrients vital to nerves and blood vessels, and balance out your diet.

Most people with diabetes have to deal with heart disease, so you will want to pay attention to the fat and salt in your diet.  Reducing the number of servings of red meat in a week, choosing roasted chicken or turkey sandwich meats, grilled chicken breast when out, salmon steaks instead of beef or pork.  If it comes in a box or bag or can, or from a drive through, it is most likely very high in salt.  Try  to reduce the frequency of those types of foods. 

Exercise increases your body's ability to use the insulin you do produce, or the insulin you take.  So even if it is just ten minutes a couple times a day at first, any way you can find to get moving will  help to lower your blood sugars.   But the benefits may not be immediate, so don't give up.  Keep going and gradually add more time as you are able.


It is important that you have lipid panels done annually, twice yearly A1c, foot exams, yearly eye exams(dilated) and blood pressure checks at each visit to your physician.  Your physician should also be monitoring your kidney function, via a urinalysis.  

If you were to select a health goal to work on this year, what would be something you would like to improve on?  For example, exercise regularly, lose weight, reduce a1c, reduce blood pressure.  

Thank you- I will await your reply.

Left message for member to return my call regarding important KYN results.  Also mailed letter.
Talked with member about KYN results.  He states he was nervous at the screening because of the blood draw- his bp always goes up when he has to have blood drawn.  His bp usually is 120/70s.   Encouraged him to have it rechecked to make sure it isn't consistently running high.  He eats heart healthy- no fried foods, lots of fruits/vegetable.  He does exercise 30 minutes a day on the treadmill most days of the week.  Congratulated him on his good health efforts.
Member has seen MD and reviewed KYN results with MD.  HgbA1c 5.7, Totasl cholesterol 201, triglycerides 165.  MD suggested weight loss.  Watching portions and increasing vegetables and fruits.  Walks with wife am and pm.  Encouraged continued diet and exercise.  
Discussed A1c and BP being abnormally high at KYN screening. See email note which reviews all we discussed. Very pleasant. Turned 40yo this year. 
"Thanks for returning my call. It was a pleasure to meet you. Sorry for the not-so-great news. It could be worse.    ;o)
It sounds like you are doing a wonderful job at eating healthy and exercising, you just maybe need to tweak it a little or step it up a notch. 
You can do it and you are WORTH it!!!

These are the things we discussed:

?	Buy a BP monitor
?	Take your BP every morning for 2 weeks; write down the date, time, & numbers
?	Increase your exercise in intensity so that you are breathing heavy for 30min/day, 4 days/week 
?	Continue to drink water & avoid anything with sugar in it (sweet tea, juice, soda, alcohol)
?	Reduce red meat intake & make better choices of cut
?	Be aware of food?s sodium/salt content by reading labels and avoiding restaurants/canned foods/frozen meals as much as possible
?	Call MD office this week and make an appt for a Physical Exam asap (end of Oct if possible)
?	Check out sparkpeople.com and track sodium for 2 weeks

The best tip I can give you is to ?plan ahead?.  Place exercise times on your calendar/schedule or you most likely will not get it done. 
Planning ahead for your meals/snacks will make all the difference too. 
I don?t have your entire results in front of me (graphs, BMI, etc.), but if your BMI is above normal, getting it down (losing wt) will help your BP and A1c. 
You may want to discuss this with your physician at your appt and let me know what your goal is for the year. I practice what I preach. I lost 36# in 2010 & have kept if off.
It has changed my life; decreased the medications I take and improved my quality of life (and ability to take vacations!). 
Again, you are WORTH it!
Warm Regards,
"

Congratulated him on this accomplishment!  He states he feels much better.  He has purchased a stationary bike to use during the cooler months.  Encouraged him to keep up the great work!
"Thanks for taking time to return my call. It was a pleasure to talk with you.
I hope our conversation was helpful and that you find the above attachments helpful as well.
Here are reminders of what we discussed, for your review:
?	Goals: wt of 235# & to be healthy
?	Exercise: 
o	Plan to attend gym regularly (place on calendar/schedule & pack the day before-clothes/snack/water)
o	Possibly obtain professional trainer sessions/assistance for stretching & exercise workout strategies
o	Learn/apply stretches to prevent injury before exercising
o	Increase wt training & continue cardio
o	Use resources- smart phone apps, sparkpeople, fb, professionals
?	Diet changes:
o	Reduce saturated fat by reading labels, reducing red meat intake (or choosing cut wisely) & eating/drinking lowfat or nonfat dairy products
?	Call MD office; make appt for Dec 2013 for a Physical Exam (& have lipid panel rechecked to see if what you have done with diet & exercise is enough ?naturally? to reduce your numbers)

You also may want to do the following to help your blood sugar stay steady throughout the day (which will help you lose wt too):
?	Take in at least 3 fresh whole fruits each day (not canned). They are all natural, healthy carbs & contain lots of vitamins/minerals & fiber. 
?	Don?t drink calories (don?t drink sweet liquids like sweet tea, regular soda, juice or alcoholic beverages)
?	Avoid or at least minimize sweet foods. When you do eat them, don?t eat them on an empty stomach and substitute them for carbs at the previous meal. 
?	Eat every 3-4 hours throughout the day

Remember to take your KYN results/pkt with you when you attend your MD appt. 

Planning ahead is the best tip I can give you. You can do this. Just keep learning healthy living tips, apply them to your life and repeat. 
You are WORTH it!
Warm Regards, 
"

He doesn't have a bp cuff at home.  Encouraged him to check his bp at the pharmacy or possibly get a cuff to use at home so he can keep a record of his bp.  His MD follows his diabetes.  He is working with a nutritionist to lose 37 pounds, with a GOAL weight of 200 pounds.  He is adding more whole grain foods and vegetables to his diet.  He exercises by running daily in the local park.  Encouraged him to stick with his plan, and to follow up with his MD and nutritionist as scheduled.  Will follow up with him in December to check his progress.  He declined any further educational literature, stated he had a supply.

Spoke with member on the phone.  States she has had lots of appts since the healthcare screening.  Many problems with foot.  Seeing an orthopedist, been on crutches and now has a boot.  Pain from foot was probably the reason her BP was so high.  On BP meds and Chol meds.  Going back to doctor Oct 21 for physical. 
"Talked with member, reviewed his biometric screening results.  He does not have a family history of diabetes.  He has had MI x 2, the most recent being in Feb 2013.  He has several stents in place.  He was participating in a cardiac rehab program but had to stop due to arthritis in his foot.  He last saw his cardiologist in June 2013, at that time he was doing well.  He sees his primary MD in November.  He feels he is more tired recently than he was in the summer--and isn't scheduled to see his cardiologist until June of 2014.  Encouraged him to contact the cardiologist because this is a change in his status and the MD would want to be aware.  He has a BP cuff at home.  Encouraged him to check his BP daily and record the readings, then share with his MD when he goes for his next appt.  He does take bp medication and lipid lowering medication.  He is tolerating both well.  His MD reduced his lipid lowering med. dose to help with the side effects of aches and pains.  Discussed ways to help reduce a1c, and the reason it is important. He does drink sweet tea and an occasional soda.  Suggested unsweetened tea or using an artificial sweetener.  He doesn't eat many sweets.  Reviewed diet changes to make, including changing to whole grains in stead of white products.  Suggested creative ways to exercise, including water aerobics, stationary bicycle, but to check with his MD first before beginning any exercise program.  His goal is to be able to exercise regularly again.  His MD treated his foot with cortisone, he feels it is slowly improving.

"Hey ..............
Thank you so much for returning my call. It?s great to hear that you are already on a journey to a healthier lifestyle. Way to go!
Congrats on losing the 17#.  Keep taking baby steps, progressing towards a healthier lifestyle. 
Fad diets don?t work. Simply learn a healthy fact (tip), apply it to your life, keep doing it, learn another one, etc. That?s it. 
You are not alone. We are all on this journey together. You can do it and you?re WORTH it!

Just for review, here are some of the things we discussed:
?	Continue to reduce diet Coke intake (Yay! You reduced it by half already!)
?	Continue exercising (maybe walk for 15 min on the other 4 days?)
?	When you want to drink a glass of wine or eat a dessert, skip eating any carbs for dinner (or previous meal)
?	Don?t eat sweets on an empty stomach
?	Try to eat every 3-4 hours throughout the day
?	Reduce/avoid red meat (eat more chicken, fish, turkey, nuts)
?	Reduce starchy foods and be aware of how much a serving is (most of the time it?s � cup ?potatoes, rice, pasta, corn for example)
?	Eat at least 3 fresh whole fruits (learning which are low in the Glycemic Index & how much is a serving)
?	Keep your MD appt on Oct 20th
?	Make an appt with MD for 3 months from now & ask him/her to recheck A1c to see if what you?ve done with exercise & diet have been enough to reduce it

Setting goals helps us reach them. What goal do you have in mind for diet Coke? How about making the first goal to be one/morning and one/afternoon? Something to reach for. Just a suggestion.
Whatever you are comfortable with and how fast or slow you want to move is fine. Just keep heading in the right direction as you are now.  ;o)

I hope you find the above attachments helpful. I recommend printing the ?Tips for a Healthier You?, reviewing it, placing today?s date beside any tip/bullet you are already doing, place it on your frig, and keep adding a tip to your lifestyle weekly or monthly, however fast or slow you want to change. I hope this isn?t too much information at once. I don?t mean to overload you. Please feel free to call or email for questions, support or additional information. 
I am here to assist you with your journey to a healthier lifestyle and to reach your health goals. 

It was a pleasure speaking with you. Thanks for the encouraging words. You made my day. 
Its not often that we hear ?thanks? in a customer relations setting, as I?m sure you experience as well. 
I look forward to hearing from you. 
Remember, if we don?t quit?we win (Gal 6:9). 
Warm Regards,
"
"Thanks Kim.

Hopefully I will be able to jumpstart some L-B loss.  I did a little research yesterday and today and  found a few more resources you can add to your arsenal of suggestions.

There is a free app (at least it is free on the Google Marketplace) called ?Sworkit?.  The cool part about this app is that it syncs with ?MyFitnessPal? automatically adjusting the calorie count for the day.  Also the app customizes a work out for you depending on different variables including duration, muscle group, and type (cardio/yoga vs. strength training).  It also seems that most of the workout suggestions are bodyweight exercises only.

Another resource I found actually came to me as I was walking on the treadmill at the gym.  There is a show on Food Network called ?Hungry Girl?.  The episode I watched had a multitude of quick-made, low calorie foods (which I believe is her shtick).  For lunch today I made one of her recipes for ?Scoopable Chinese Chicken Salad? (link) and much to my surprise, it was delicious, filling and low on calories.

Just thought I would pass along some stuff I stumbled across since we spoke.

Hope you have a good day!

He was told insurance would not cover One Touch supplies.  Exp that did not come from us.  That we would cover his testing strips & supplies.
"
"Reviewed KYN results.  He doesn't have a family history of diabetes.  Reviewed his a1c of 5.8, discussed ways to reduce it and why reduction is important.  He does drink regular sodas and eats lots of ice cream.  He doesn't have a regular exercise program.  Discussed diet changes that may be helpful in reducing the a1c, to include changing to diet sodas/unsweet tea/ just drinking water; try eating sugar free ice cream, and being mindful of portions not only for ice cream but other treats as well;  changing from white products to whole grains.  Member set a GOAL to reduce his a1c by making these diet changes and exercising (walking) 2-3 times per week as a beginning point.  He does take bp medication (edalbychlor), he has his bp checked occasionally at work.  Encouraged him to write down these readings and share with his MD at his next visit (scheduled for later this month).  He had been on cholesterol lowering medication but his MD discontinued it.  Encouraged him to take his KYN results with him to his MD visit in October.
Will follow up with him in December 2013 to check progress of exercise."
Sorry for the delayed reply. My gym does not have the BP monitor. I will make an effort to stop and check it at Wal Mart or what have you, weekly.

Member is excited that she has almost reached her goal!!  She has lost 18 pounds through following weight watchers and working out regularly.  Congratulated her on this accomplishment, encouraged her to keep up the great work!  She plans to lose 2 more pounds to reach her first goal of 20 pounds, then work on the next ten pounds.  She will follow up with her physician to have labs rechecked.
Met to do TOB #3.  She said she is nervous to try any NRT because she is not sure what it will do to her.  I encouraged her to try and start with the gum or lozenge first.  She said she wants to quit but has not made up her mind fully.  She wants to be around for her grandkids and she knows quitting would keep her around longer.  Going to continue to think about starting a NRT.

Received a response from member that it is ok to call her now at work.  Called, reviewed KYN results.  She has not reviewed them with her MD yet.  She enjoys cooking and using different spices.  Exercising is very difficult due to arthritis and spinal stenosis.  Discussed creative ways to exercise- she is not a fan of water aerobics.  Suggest possibly a stationary bike, possibly a recumbent one that would put less stress on the spine.   Her GOAL for the year is to lose 40 pounds.  She has lost two pounds so far by cutting portions and not eating late at night.  She doesn't eat much red meat.  She loves vegetables and this is what most of her diet is composed of.

"Hi Kim,
Thank you for the information.  My request was for my daughter, she is lactose intolerant.  During health fair there was a pocket calorie chart for fast food restaurants, and I was wondering if there was a pocket chart for people with lactose intolerance.  I was hoping to have a pocket chart for my daughter, so that she can reference that when I am not around to help guide her.  I have downloaded the nutrition/ allergen charts from various restaurants.   
Thank you,
"
"Sorry to say that there is no such guide as far as I (my coworkers and google search) know.

10/10 Call from Joan wanting to know if she had sent the H2O log for Wayne's Q4 healthy rewards.  Exp that we had not yet recd.  States she knows he completed but is unable to find.  Discussed that I would resend then found out Wayne had proceeded to get his diab eye exam done.  So will allow that as Q4 reward.  States she has been concerned lately over his BP; phys are continuing to adjust meds.  BS has been good.  She will keep me posted.
10/10 Call from Arleta as she had recd the diab CAP info & also wanted to make sure I was aware she had her mammo done.  Exp that I had noted that & $$ will be added to her acct for getting it done.  States she has had lost weight; was 321# now down to 286#. Has cut way back, stayed away from sweets except for rare occasion.  Also changed physicians who is totally revamping her meds.  Could not believe she was on so many; all were working against her.  Has been weaning Cymbalta & should be off by next week.  Referring to psychiatrist to manage the Wellbutrin.  She is \tickled to death\", can maybe \"see the light at the end of the tunnel\".  Wellness program is fantastic.  Discussed next goal and she mentioned another 25# by end of year.  Enc her to think in small chunks; easier to tackle consider just getting into new numbers.  She liked that & will work towards & keep me posted."
"13 	poor follow thru from last call. Not checking bg&#39;s but 3 x per wk, c/o neuropathy - teaching that this is a sign of a high bg.

"Hi Kim,

I set up my physical for Jan 2.  That was going to be the best available time given the holidays however probably not the best time considering holiday eating (going to try my best).  
I just wanted to let you know.

Thanks again,

"Awesome ............!
Would you be willing to call your MD office, ask what your last A1c was and let me know? 

Remember that cutting back from eating everything white will make a big difference. 
Plan ahead for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Having a battle plan will help.
Warm Regards,

"Hi Kim,

Have started getting some really good exercise.  We purchased a Concept2 rowing machine.  Since 9/17 I have rowed for 98,000 Meters (while missing 5 days on an out of town trip) which is the equivalent of almost 60 miles.  Will be getting new blood work in 2 weeks and can update numbers then.

Thanks,
"
"Can?t wait to hear from you with your new numbers!
Please shoot me an email (or call) after your MD appt and let me know what they are.
Way to go on that rowing machine! Impressive.

When did you last check your BP and what were the #s?

Thanks for the updates!
Kim

"Hi Kim,
I?m doing better!  I joined Weight Watchers at Work ? first meeting was July 9th ? and I?ve lost 32.8 lb.  That recently brought me over my 10% goal.  This is a great program that I feel can work long term for me.  I?m eating more fruits and veggies and lean proteins with less, way less, fast food and sweets.
  
I saw Dr. Franco in September and he was VERY pleased.  I?m supposed to go by fasting for a new A1c test, but I haven?t done that yet.   He does late appointments on Tuesdays so it?s always too late to draw blood when I see him.   My next appointment with Dr. Franco is in December but I plan to go by soon for that blood work as I?m also anxious to know if that A1c has come down.

Would stress affect that?  We?ve sold our home in order to downsize and our offer on another home has been accepted.  So we are in the middle of  packing, planning, paperwork, phone calls, arrangements, appointments, etc. all while working full time.  We are looking at closing and moving at end of Oct. or Nov. 1st.   Should I wait until things are a little more settled in November?

Thanks much!
"
"YAY! Great job joining Wt Watchers and losing 33#! Go girl! 
No need to wait to get your blood work rechecked. I think it will encourage you. But its up to you. 

Are you exercising any? 
I know you are ?working? by packing/moving, but cardio is important. Even if you get up in the morning and dance to 3 songs!  ;o)
Congrats on the new home. Send me a pic if you can. 
Please shoot me an email and let me know how you are doing from time to time.
And if you will let me know what your next A1c is. 
Were you diagnosed with diabetes?
Did they do the GTT (Glucose Tolerance Test) where you drink something sweet and check your blood sugar for 2-3 hours?

Thanks for the update!!!

Member called in response to message.  She said she is down to 134 pounds, only nine pounds away from her goal of 125 pounds.  Congratulated her on this!  She continues to exercise and eat better.  She lives in an area that will allow for continued outdoor walking, states she will be able to walk outside throughout the winter, it will be cool there but not frigid.  She sees her nurse practitioner in January for follow up.  She has questions about the synthroid that she was prescribed, she isn't sure why she is taking it.  Encouraged her to ask her provider for more information so she is more comfortable with her medications.  Will follow up with her in February, hopefully to celebrate her reaching her goal weight.
Member saw his MD with screening results, MD gave him a good report.  Wasn't concerned about his bp- member states it usually is 120s/80ish.  Encouraged him to check it at different times, just to be sure it isn't running high without him knowing it.  He agreed to do so.  Reviewed his cholesterol /triglyceride reading, he states his wife is careful about what she cooks.  Encouraged him to continue to eat heart healthy and exercise as much as possible.

Left message for member to return my call re: biometric screening results.
Talked with member, she did talk with her MD about screening results.  MD was pleased with her numbers.  She does not take any BP medication.  She is not sure what her BP usually runs, if the screening result was higher or lower than normal.  Encouraged her to check it again, see if it is below the 120/ 80 level.  She is working to reduce her cholesterol by diet and exercise- she eats lots of vegetables.  Discussed other ways to help reduce cholesterol- decrease red meat consumption, exercise.  Her goal is to lose some weight--she is currently at 170 pounds, would like to be at 125.  She is frustrated because she has been doing all the right things to lose weight, but hasn't lost any.  She shared that her mother had the same problem.  Encouraged her to talk with her MD about this.  
Spoke to member on phone.  She said she had lost my number and had looked for it yesterday..  Checked BP while I was on the phone.  140/88  Pulse 121.  Asked member why pulse was so high?  States she takes medication to bring it down but if she takes the entire pill it makes her feel \weak\"  so her doctor told her to take 1/2 x2 a day but now that is not lowering her pulse enough.  Encouraged to talk with her doctor about it when she goes back to see him.

Member called in response to msg.  She did see her MD and reviewed her biometric screening results.  She has been diabetic for several years.  She sees her MD every six months for management of her diabetes and BP.  She takes BP medication.  She stated that she is Asian and she likes to eat rice, she has it frequently for dinner.  She does eat smaller portions than she did in the past.  Encouraged her to use brown rice- she doesn't like it.  She is aware of the importance of diet and exercise in controlling her blood sugars.  She exercises but not as regularly as she would like- she gets started but then doesn't follow through.  Suggested that she find an exercise buddy, someone to help keep her accountable.  And to set an attainable goal to begin with, maybe to exercise at least 2-3 times per week to being with, and increase as it become easier to make that happen.  She doesn't feel she can utilize a buddy, because her routine is very sporadic with caring for her parents and her children.  Encouraged her to work toward some regular routine that will help her reach her goal.

Member states his MD has been following him closely for the past 2-3 years for elevated blood sugars and triglycerides.  He doesn't have a family history of diabetes.  His a1c a couple months ago was 6.  A couple of years ago he changed his diet to be a low carbohydrate diet, and his a1c went down to 3-4.  But then he said he became bored with the diet and began eating bread/pasta/white products again.  He is currently in the process of going back to the low carb diet--removing the 'white' products from his pantry.  He reports his blood sugar at the screening was 152- he had his copy of the results there at home with him.  Discussed diet changes and exercise to help reduce blood sugars/a1c- he is limited in the amount of exercise he can do due to CHF.  His medications include coumadin, ASA, Coreg, prilosec, vitamin D, and pravastatin.  His GOAL is to reduce his a1c by changing his diet.

"Have received notification that member has created his password.  Sent encrypted email as follows:   
 Hello!  I trust this finds you well.  My apologies I know it has been a couple of days since you created your password- I have been out of the office screening with another client.  
Your results are as follows:
Fasting Blood Sugar-  98   This is normal.  The desired range is below 100.

Blood Pressure 138/94   The desired level is below 120/80.  At 138/94, your blood pressure is elevated.   Does this run in your family?  Do you have a BP monitor at home that you could check your BP with, and keep a record of the readings to share with your physician?  
Lowering the amount of salt in your diet can help reduce your blood pressure.  Salt (sodium) is found in fast food, canned food, restaurants, sauces, tomato products, cheese, snack foods.  Look for American Heart Assoc. Heart on freezer meals and canned soups, indicating that they contain less sodium.  Rinse canned vegetables, tuna, etc., to reduce the amount of sodium.  If your physician prescribes blood pressure medication, take it as scheduled.  If you experience side effects, tell your doctor so you can work together to find something you can tolerate.  

Total cholesterol  254   Elevated.  The desired level is below 200.  

Triglycerides   331  Elevated.  The desired level is below 150.  

With regard to cholesterol and triglycerides:  It is beneficial to have plenty of fiber in your diet.  Fiber is not absorbed by the body- it absorbs cholesterol and fat and helps remove it from the body.  Try adding whole grains to your diet- such as whole wheat toast, brown rice, whole wheat multi grain crackers or bagels.  Exercise?even ten minutes a day?will help in managing  your cholesterol and triglycerides.   Reducing saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol in your diet can improve triglyceride levels as well as help manage cholesterol.  Alcohol has strong effects on triglyceride levels.  Drinking more than one drink a day for women or two for men can raise triglyceride levels considerably.  Some people with high triglycerides may need to cut out alcohol entirely.
Eat more fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids in stead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega-3 fatty acids. 
Fresh fruits and vegatables are a great way to increase fiber in your diet.  


Do you have a regular physician?  Have you  reviewed  your screening results with him/her?  What recommendations did he/she make?  

What medications, if any, do you take on a regular basis?  Do you have a regular exercise program?
Lots of questions!  I look forward to your response.  Have a great afternoon!

Actually his screening BP was in pre-hypertensive range. Advised him to check with his physician and to watch his number as it was beginning to creep on him.
Had annual in September. Had stress testing done in 2012 and all checked out good. She has regular checkups and states that Dr. has never shown concern for her glucose or A1C. Was a former smoker and has been quit for past 7 months. 
Mr. Ford is a person i have struggled to get in compliance for a good while. His intentions are good but financial matters usually get in his way. He does not have primary physician and states that even co-pays are difficult for him. I have and continue to explain to him the importance of getting his checkups, usually to the tune of the same old outcome. I was able to get him a few years back to have tests and blood work done, and at that time, surprisingly his numbers were better than i would have ever expected. 
Mr. Williams states that he followed up with physician and was placed on small dosage of BP medication, HCTZ 12.5mg. Claims that his glucose checked out good during visit and would probably be able to come of med after losing some weight. I informed him that he needed to tell physician to recheck A1C that they probably would not check unless he requested.  States he will inform him during next visit.
TEP #5. Still Tob free. Feels like this could be a permanent change.

Martin has made many behavior changes in his diet since our last meeting.  He has  changed to whole grain foods, eliminating almost all white flour and white sugar products, has increased his fresh vegetables and fruits, and eating healthful proteins.  Over the summer he took bike rides of 45 ? 90 minutes. He states he only wears his helmet ~ 50% of time, as he finds it uncomfortable. Weight is now 197.4 (decrease of 13.4 pounds) and waist is now 38? (decrease 3?).  I praised him for his positive changes.  He has free weights at home, and also a membership at YouFit neither of which he has not been using.  Martin agrees to:  1) Begin an evening routine, before dinner, to use his free weights 3-4x/week, (twice M-F, twice on the w/e).  2) Get a new helmet that fits properly and is comfortable.   No follow up appt. as I feel when he gets his next labs done, the prediabetes will no longer be a problem.

During visit with Mr. DeCosta he immediately informs me that he has cut back on smoking from 5 cigarettes to 2 per day. Went from 4 sodas per day to one in the a.m. Has changed his dietary habits and has lost 13lbs in last 3 months. Claims that Dr. checked his BP and it was little elevated..

Since screening Mr. Moore has visited his physician 2x. Has another scheduled appt. in December. He was diagnosed as hypertensive and was prescribed medication. As for his cholesterol and glucose, he states that all those numbers checked out good. Claims that day of screening he was not fasting and that probably had a lot to do do with his elevated numbers.

"Good Afternoon Ms. Hill,

I went and got my physical today and have attached a receipt for my co-pay to this email. At my physical I reviewed my Doctor?s Direct results with my physician and she gave me tips on what I can do to have a more healthy lifestyle and to decrease my risk for certain medical conditions.

I?m not sure if there is anything additionally that I need to do to make sure that I am in compliance with the CAPE Wellness program. Please let me know if this is sufficient or if there is something else that I will need to do.

Thank You,
Erin Edwards

"Thanks for taking time to return my call.
Congrats on already making all the changes you have by losing wt, exercising, researching info. and attending classes!

This is a reminder to ask Dr. Mass about getting a GTT (Glucose Tolerance Test);
Register for www.sparkpeople.com; and obtain the all natural sugar substitute called ?Stevia?.
Don?t buy the big bag at the grocery stores. Get the little container (like ground cinnamon comes in).
The brand I buy has a red top & a miniature spoon inside. It costs around 10$, but it lasts for months. 
If you normally add 2 teaspoons of sugar to your coffee, you would add 2 of the tiny spoonfuls of Stevia. 
Hope this helps.
Keep up the great work you are doing. You are WORTH IT!

"My last pap was October 2011 ? my doctor says I can do one every 3 years so the next one would be due next year
I have not done a colonoscopy           
"
"Carole,
I understand completely.
CAPE guidelines state to be compliant you must have a PAP every year for their program and a Colonoscopy after 50 years of age.  
That would give you 2 non compliant points.  You can have one non compliant point and still get the discount but not two.  
You need to do one or the other to be compliant for 2013.

Based on my medical history and the recommendation of my doctor re the annual pap I suppose I will just have to forgo the discount with CAPE?s medical

"Carole,

You realize if you get a colonoscopy which is recommended nationally after the age of 50 you can get the discount.

Member states he had both knees replaced last January, is doing well with recovery now, but was inactive for some time afterward.  He has gained weight and doesn't feel good about being over 300 pounds.  He is joining the YMCA next month (when he can go free) so he can begin a regular exercise program again.  Encouraged him to review his KYN results with his MD.  He takes his bp med regulary.  Reviewed his elevated a1c, and discussed measures to reduce it, including weight loss, exercise, and diet changes.  He drinks an occasional soda, occasional sweet tea, but not many sweetened drinks.  He does like orange juice.  Encouraged him to reduce the amount he is drinking, maybe get the 50% less sugar version.   
"Aileen,
My wife had her annual exam with her OB/GYN on 27 September 2013 with Dr. Farhart.  She reviewed the ?Know your Numbers? packet with him and he signed the front page (see attached).
 
I had my annual physical last week on 24 October 2013.  I also took a copy of my ?Know your Numbers? packet.  I have attached the report given to me after the physical.
 
Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do in order to maintain compliance and continue to be eligible for the fully discounted health insurance premiums.

spoke with member. saw MD 10/28. discussed hga1c with member. will monitor no hx DM in family. bp 130/70. goal exercise. has been trying to ride bike 15 mins a day at plant but has moved offices. will increase again. aware to follow up in Jan feb with debbie. PB
Member called to ask if she should completely cut carbohydrates out of her diet.  Instructed that he body needs carbohydrates but that the amount and type of carbohydrates makes a big difference in how healthy they are.  Reports she eats high calorie sweets and white bread /rice.flour.  Instructed to eat whole grains to get the nutrients she needs.  Instructed that whole grains take longer to be broken down in our bodies and do not turn in to sugar the way white carbohydrates do.  Also instructed that activity such as walking for 20 minutes 4 times a week at a pace to get her heart rate up will burn calories and help her to loose weight.  Discussed cutting sodas with sugar in them out of her diet and drinking water.  Thanked me for helping.  Reports she will call again after she sees her physician. 
"Thanks Aileen.  I read the attached brochure.

Yes, my doctor too has always recommended doing the colonoscopy.  For some unknown reason I just find it repulsive.  I do the three sets of stool samples each year.

I feel extremely stressed doing the numerous medical procedures,  which all come at the end of the year,  in order to be compliant for the medical insurance.  Right now I have a bone density and mammogram coming up, just finished with the dentist, also do an annual MRI and see the ENT specialist following surgery 3 years ago.   I really do not want to have to go back to the doctor?s office again.  All my vacation time is being absorbed by the doctor?s office.

I frustrates me  to understand why CAPE requires a pap annually when after a certain age and based on medical history the doctor feels every 3 years is sufficient.  I suppose these tests are required for everyone regardless.

Did not realize that my medical insurance had been discounted so I guess I will be using my entire pay check to pay medical insurance ?

Message left this morning for me to call her back to cover know your number results.
Return call made to member.  vm message left with Doctor's Direct Healthcare number to call me back. 
"Member returned call & stated: He is OFF of BP meds!; is watching his salt intake, is exercising daily by swimming at the YMCA at lunch, has goal to swim a minimum of 4d/week; has LOST 20# since KYN screening; enlisted help of friend and wife; Saw MD 2 weeks ago & was not taking BP meds; BP was 118/75, A1c was 5.9 (down from 6.3 at KYN), & chol 114 (down from 135).

VERY pleasant & motivated. Stated this KYN screening was a wake up call & he's tired of being a big boy.  Requested ideas for BK & is agreeable to receive ed. materials via email at wk. "
"Carole,

I think that CAPE and other female members in the CAPE compliance program would benefit by knowing that because of certain procedures,(ie. Hysterectomies, full or partial, removal of cervix) that the medical community does not recommend a PAP exam but every 3 yrs.  

This is a website that explains the PAP and recommendations

http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm

http://www.acog.org/About%20ACOG/Announcements/New%20Cervical%20Cancer%20Screening%20Recommendations.aspx

Could you call your doctors office and ask if the nurse could send you that recommendation in writing?  I have all ideas that CAPE would accept this as an exception since that is what your doctor recommends for your health and well being.

Get that colonoscopy!  IF you are older that 50 you really need to have one.  You will miss one day of work.  Do it on a Friday.  You may feel tired on Saturday but probably not.

I will be contacting K Smothers with the following articles so that CAPE can address this recommendation from your doctor. 

Thanks Aileen

Member called to go over know your number results.  Discussed AIC of  5.7 and that this is a look at her glucose average over a 3 month period. 5.7 is pre-diabetes.  Instructed re: using whole grains instead of white carbohydrates.  Reports she does not exercise.  Discussed walking for 20 minutes 3 to 4 times a week.  instructed to take her KYN results with her to her physician so that he can follow up on her AIC level and see if she reduces it after changing carbohydrates to whole grains and incorporating exercise in her routine.  Agrees to do so. 
Participant stated she thought she was already enrolled as a member, but received a letter that she was not complete.  I explained that she was missing her 2013 blood work.  She has had BW done with her dr. in the past six months and will send in qualification form.

"Hey ....,
Thanks for returning my call. It was a pleasure to speak with you.
It was so exciting to hear your good news. I?m SO proud of you!!! Good job!

Above are several attachments. This is a load of information. Don?t mean to overwhelm you, but I know you are Motivated AND have great support from your wife and friend. SO?

Attachments: 
?	?Tips?: print it, scan the bullets; put today?s date beside any bullets which you are already doing; post it on your frig or at your desk or somewhere where you will see it every day; add one tip per week or month (however fast or slow you want to move toward a healthier lifestyle). Fad diets don?t work long term. Just take these baby steps & keep progressing toward a ?healthy lifestyle?
?	Fav. Recipes: try them. Share with your wife & email them to your friend if you like (anything I send you, you can share with others)
?	Glycemic index (GI): The higher the GI, the faster the sugar, in that food, dumps into your blood stream (which leads to wt gain). Avoid the red section & learn what each fruit?s serving size is. Print & share with your wife for better choices while grocery shopping and meal planning.
?	All about carb counting: just read and absorb what grabs you and apply it. Reread every 3-6 months. Share with your wife & friend.
?	Choose fats wisely: just read and absorb what grabs you and apply it. Reread every 3-6 months. Share with your wife & friend.

Bk ideas: (Remember to read labels and know what a serving is. As a man, you may need 2 servings of complex carbs [starchy foods] & protein)
?	Steel cut oatmeal with ? cup of blueberries (or a serving of any fruit in it) or a serving of walnuts (which increases the protein)
?	?Bob?s Red Mill? ?Whole Grain 10 Grain Hot Cereal? (Most Harris Teeters carry this; some health food stores carry it.) 
?	An egg cooked on a thin ?round? which is ?whole grain?
?	If you have a simple blender you can make your own smoothie with protein powder (see attachment)
?	Whole grain toast w 1 serving of peanutbutter (Smucker?s has all natural peanutbutter, no extra ingred. Except some salt).
?	Try scrambles eggs or Egg Beaters with saut?ed spinach. Add smoked salmon, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, salsa or whatever you like as long as it?s a healthy item. (feel free to ask me when you have an idea?ask me if its really healthy or not. Avoid adding cheese if possible)
?	See additional attachment of ?Healthy Breakfast Ideas?

Tracking your nutritional intake on www.sparkpeople.com will help tremendously, even if you only do it for 2 weeks. There is also a smart phone app ($3.99 cost) which makes it very easy to keep up with. 
Are you taking a multi-Vitamin? I highly recommend a healthy multi-Vit. For men (one that really digests so your body is able to benefit from it).

Hope this is helpful.
Let me know how you are doing by calling or emailing me monthly is what I suggest. Then give me your current wt, latest BP, how you are doing with exercise and with healthy eating. 
Warm Regards,
"
Member and wife have appt scheduled for NOV 1 and NOV 11th.

"Hi Aileen

I just got my Know Your Numbers paperwork.

According to your email below, all my numbers should be under the 50% modifiable risk and you said I do not need a physical. So I canceled the physical appointment. However, reviewing the paperwork I just received, I actually have 1 modifiable risk at 50% and another at 60% which would mean I have to get a physical or  pay the higher rate.

This is the same exact thing that happened last year. If you recall, you told me I did not have to get  a physical because my numbers were all in line and then I got hit with the higher rate because they actually were not. And I had to keep paying until I was able to get a physical. Thankfully, I was reimbursed for most of this. Last year I figured it was just a mistake, but now that it has happened again, can you please review my records and make sure that they are correct? My concern is either I am getting the wrong information in the mail or you have the wrong information in your system since what you have told me now two years in a row has been inaccurate with the results I receive in the mail.

Thanks,

Tim Stewart
"
"Tim, 

I have reviewed the results again at your request.
In 2011 you had RISK GREATER than 50%.  In 2012 you had less than 50% Mod. Risk. This would mean you do not have to have a physical for the next 3 years (2015)according to the CAPE Guidelines. You would have to screen in 2015 anyway because you will be 40yrs old.

I am sorry for my mistake in the past.  I really am doing the best I can.  

As a nurse I encourage you to get a physical every year.

Aileen


Aileen T. Hill RN BSN CCM

"Aileen

We need to talk then because your records do not match the paperwork that I have. Every year (including 2012), I have had a modifiable risk higher than 60% for diabetes and higher than 50% for stroke. So we need to get these records straight since it affects my health insurance. Somehow the records you have in your system that you are reviewing do not match the paperwork I have here in my hands.

2011:
Diabetes: 71%
Stroke: 58%

2012:
Diabetes: 62%
Stroke: 51%

2013:
Diabetes: 60%
Stroke: 50%

Please call me at 609-891-7495 when you have a minute to discuss.

Tim
"
"Tim, 

Could not wait til this afternoon to recheck the info a little closer.  

YOU are absolutely correct.  My numbers match yours. 
I some how missed the elevated numbers.  
Your risk ARE higher than 50% modifiable risk.

Thank you so much for going back to check  your profile and bringing it to my attention. 
I have corrected the mistake and will let K. Smothers know.
Sorry for any confusion.

See your doctor and email me the receipt.


Again Thank you

"Hi Dawn,
Glad to hear your shoulder surgery went well and especially that you had no pain!!  And that you lost weight during your leave---that is awesome!  Did you continue with  Nutrasystem?  What is your weight now?  And do you have a goal weight in mind?  It helps to set a goal, that way you know when you have arrived, and can celebrate!
  I remember you were looking forward to being able to exercise more after the shoulder surgery.  With the back issues you should definitely check with your physician before starting anything new ( I know you probably know that already?).  Sometimes they will recommend low impact activities (water aerobics are particularly helpful).  I hope you get some resolution for the back problems soon.  

Any changes in your medications?  Particularly your blood pressure medicine?  And are you tolerating the Lipitor (you started taking a whole tablet again, right?)?   I?m wondering when your MD will be repeating the lipid panel. Usually with weight loss, increased exercise, medication, and diet changes,  you will see the cholesterol numbers  improve.  It?s a great feeling when you see the results of your hard work!

Have a great evening, I look forward to hearing back from you!

"Chris, 
You need to have a colonoscopy but you are compliant for 2013.

As for your wife, it does look like from claims she had a Dr. appt to review her KYN results on 10/31/12.
It also looks like she saw her Primary Care Physician on  FEB 18, 2013 and from the diagnosis listed I know he did a physical. 
That would mean she is ?compliant?  through March of 2014 for a PHYSICAL.  If she sees her medical doctor between now and  the end of March 2014  email me and let me know and I can extend her compliance DATE for her physical.  The CAPE guidelines are that you need to have a Primary Care Physician and  have to see them once a year or every 12 mos she has completed this part.   

CAPE guidelines asked that females have a PAP exam every year and a MAMMO every 2yrs.  I don?t see claims for these in the last 2 yrs.  She needs to get these to be compliant for  2013.  Because the last date I have is PAP in 2010 and Mammo in 2010.   Claims show up in my system 6-8 wks later so if she has had these test done, email me the date, doctors name and the city and state the doctors office is in.

I have the date of her colonoscopy as 9/20/12. That is from? Claims? in her record.

Your wife has 2 non compliant points for 2013 and that would put you paying the higher premium.
If you will send me the info requested above I will be glad to make changes to your compliance.


Thanks Aileen

Weight today 144 lb. Molly ate at the Golden Coral on Sunday. She started out eating healthily but then had a piece of Carrot Cake. She enjoyed it so much that she had another slice and then added crab cake sliders and assortment of other unhealthy foods. We then discussed the pitfalls of eating at buffet restaurants, i.e. the all you can eat mindset, eating to get your money's worth. We discussed how refined sugar triggers the pleasure centers in the brain to promote addictive behaviors. We discussed becoming more mindful of food choices and be how foods affect mood and thought processes. Advised her to use Calorie King and My Fitness Pal to keep tract of food intake.

She did see her MD about the screening results and her MD recommended some lifestyle changes to help reduce her cholesterol and triglycerides.  She is on a three month trial of diet modification and exercise, will have her labs repeated in December, then possibly start on a medication for her cholesterol if the lifestyle changes don't reduce her cholesterol.    She doesn't eat much red meat, mostly chicken and fish, she eats oatmeal regularly.  Encouraged her to change from white to whole grain products.  She doesn't eat out very often, or eat processed foods. She and her husband have joined the gym and are doing both cardio and light weights.  She has reduced her consumption of wine.

Talked with spouse, member is at work- he said to call back Monday 11/4 early to talk with her before she goes to work.
"Kim, I saw my doctor today and he is really pleased with my progress.  He has released me and I return to work on Monday. My blood pressure was slightly elevated, but he was not overly concerned. He said that my readings for two weeks from the physical therapist were within normal range.
I may buy a home blood pressure cuff.  Do you think that is a good idea?
"
TEP # 3. Chewed twice yesterday but has not had any today. He left his can at home. Still feels good about goal of one chew a day. 
TEP # 3
"That?s great news. Thanks for sharing it with me. 
Yes, indeed. It is a great idea to have a BP monitor at home. 
You can:
?	check it for 2 weeks (every day 1st thing in the morning) & see what your avg is (take those with you to your next MD appt
?	check your BP when you don?t feel well (& when you call your MD office for an appt, you can tell them)
?	check your BP once a month to make sure it isn?t creeping up to stroke level
?	check family member?s BP when they are at your home & educate them about BP & how you can get it down to normal by not smoking, by exercising and eating healthy.

Good job! So proud of you for quitting smoking & taking control of your health! 
Keep up the good work. 

Warm Regards,
Kim

TEP # 2. Told his wife about quite date for accountability. Suggested telling coworkers so they too can hold him accountable and be respectful. Would like to try to reach this long term goal by delaying and reducing triggers. Trigger is smoking in garage... so not going to the garage for phone calls. Smokes about a pack a day ~1 per hour. Believes he needs to be mindful of not smoking all the time. Suggested putting note on cigarettes \Do you need one right now?\"  He thought he may do a log of time between cigarettes. Goal: push to 1 hr 15 min between each cigarette and up this twice a week (tues 1 1/2 hours). Not going to garage for phone calls. "
Member returned call and stated: he sees an endocrinologist Dr. Dennis Becker. Eats a large amount of rice (wife confirmed he eats 2 cups of rice at every meal). Stated his BS came down since last year from 388 to this year's KYN results at 267. Has cut out soda and switched from white rice to brown rice. Eats 6-7 pieces of bread for Bk on the weekends. pleasant but seems to either be in denial or not fully understand. Made excuses that he is from another country and his body is used to eating lots of carbs.

"Aileen,

Hello!  My name is Harriett Flynn.  My husband, Les, is an employee at Cape Environmental Management, Inc.  I have received my health screening lab results and the information accompanying it.  I have a question for you regarding the compliance grid.  I recently (mid-Sept) had my annual exam at my gynecologist's office.  Does that satisfy the requirement for a physical?  They checked my weight, BP, and I had an overall physical exam including Pap smear.  I did not get my cholesterol checked (this is specifically mentioned in the compliance grid), since Doctors Direct did the cholesterol screening already.  My cholesterol results were all within normal range.  So, do I need to have a physical with an Internal Medicine doctor, or will the check-up with my Gyn suffice?  Do I need to document this somehow to be compliant?

Thank you,
Harriett Flynn

"Aileen,

Thanks for your phone call.  To follow up, for my annual check-up, I went to my GYN on Sept 18.  I saw the Nurse Practitioner, Judy Fielder.  Their office is in Atlanta.
My husband, Les, had his annual check-up on Sept 30 with Dr. Tim Watts of Decatur, GA.  

I believe that means that both Les and I are in compliance with the guidelines for Cape.  Should you need anything else, please contact me via email or phone.

My husband received his pretty quickly and was able to share the results with his doctor.  My appointment is coming up so I need the results in order to comply with the November 1st deadline.

Thank you,
Kim Parrett (850) 293-2815

"Kim,
I was out of the office working last week sorry for the delay in getting back to you.....
I have your labs in my hand. That is what you need to take to the Dr. to review for your physical.  l.  I will be glad to fax them to you. 
 I have called this am, and then realized when I did not get an answer that you are a FEW hours behind us and that you are still snuggly in your bed.
Email me a FAX number and I will fax them right to you so that you can see your doctor.  
Remember to email me the receipt or date you had your appt and doctors name .  Please send me the date of your PAP and MAMMO for 2013. 

Happy Monday
Aileen

I no longer have a fax number so please e-mail it to me so I can print it out for my doctor?s appointment.  Also, according to the reference sheet, you only have to have a mammogram yearly after the age of 50.   I turn 50 in February and will have that in August of 2014.  My last one was December of 2012.

Did you get the labs I sent yesterday?
Aileen

"
Yes, I did thank you.
"Kim 
When I just went in to look at your Compliance status I noticed you had an appt in Nov 20 of last year.  You know you are compliant until the end of Dec  bc your insurance will not cover a physical but once a year.  You have to wait one year and one day before your next physical.
Dustin?s physical was Oct 18th last year. So he will have until Nov 30th. 
You both are good until then.

Aileen

"Aileen, 

My wife Kim forwarded the below email from you and it mentions I have not had my physical yet this year. I took the Doctors Direct report to my Dr. In September and she told me everything looked great. I attached the receipt and something I got in the mail from the appointment on that date as well.  

Let me know if you need anything else. 

Thank you and have a good weekend.

Talked with member, he did review results with his MD.  His bp typically runs in the 130s/70s, but he gets nervous when he is having blood drawn or anytime he goes to the doctor.  He said they usually have to take it 2-3 times, because he is so nervous.  He does take a low dose (1/2 tab) of lipitor daily to help manage his cholesterol.  He walks 5 miles each morning.  Over the past three years, he cut out sugar in his diet, decreased carbohydrate intake, increased his water intake, and has lost 15 pounds as a result.  His GOAL is to maintain his good health.

"Received this email from member, her answers are in capital letters:    
Glad to hear your shoulder surgery went well and especially that you had no pain!!  And that you lost weight during your leave---that is awesome!  Did you continue with  Nutrasystem?  I AM OFF AND ON.  What is your weight now?  I HAD LOST A TOTAL OF 10 LBS.   And do you have a goal weight in mind?  It helps to set a goal, that way you know when you have arrived, and can celebrate!
  I remember you were looking forward to being able to exercise more after the shoulder surgery.  With the back issues you should definitely check with your physician before starting anything new ( I know you probably know that already?).  Sometimes they will recommend low impact activities (water aerobics are particularly helpful).  I hope you get some resolution for the back problems soon. SO DO I!!!
 
Any changes in your medications? NO Particularly your blood pressure medicine?  NO And are you tolerating the Lipitor (you started taking a whole tablet again, right?)? YES  I?m wondering when your MD will be repeating the lipid panel. Usually with weight loss, increased exercise, medication, and diet changes,  you will see the cholesterol numbers  improve.  I SEE HIM IN DECEMBER.   It?s a great feeling when you see the results of your hard work!
 
Have a great evening, I look forward to hearing back from you!

"My wife was wanting  to know what she needs to do this year to fulfill requirements for gold plan.  She is 40 so we know she needs a physical and bloodwork.  I believe she also needs a breast exam and pelvic exam.  She can't remember her last pap smear.  Do you have acess to records that would indicate when she last had one done?  Is there anything else?  My wife's name is Amy Lievens.  Thanks for for assistance.

 Zack Lievens, PTFD, (372-2735, cell #)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Zach,

Amy will need to complete the following to fulfill the requirements for the Gold Plan:

    Biometrics (Bloodwork)
    Follow up- Pending biometric results
    Physical Exam
    Pap Smear Exam
    Health Risk Assessment Online

She doesn't need a breast exam because mammograms only need to be done after the age of 50.  The last pap smear we have on record is December 2011 and this needs to be done every 3 year. So she will be due for one in 2014.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

"TEP #3. He told coworkers and friends that would help keep him accountable. Took several phone calls this weekend but didn't take any in the garage. He put a note on his pack of cigarettes but mostly takes a mental note of when he last smoked. Met goal of 1.25 hrs in between cigarettes. Plans to increase tomorrow (Tues. 5th) to 1.5 hrs. Felt like mood has stayed consistent but didn't have to deal with much stress but kept busy.  Spoke with Mayor about possibly taking the stairs when he wants a smoke.

TEP #2. Didn't like smoking at first so he didn't inhale. In college learned to like Menthol's. Then learned to like regular cigarettes.  Smoked 1-2 cigarettes a day in the beginning. Limited due to money. He could tell he was having some health effects because he went from not handling regular cigarettes to liking them. Triggers: Smoking when he drives and after he eats. Doesn't feel gum is a good replacement. He likes the smoke. Tried e-cigarette but smoked more often b/c it was less money. Would like to try portable hooka because he can get fluid without nicotine and it cost more then an e-cigarette so he will have to use more sparingly. Emailed link from CDC about effects of smoking hooka on health. Would like information about Smoking effects on BG.

"Michelle,

The deadline for the plans was Monday Nov. 4th however I have been working with people to finish up this week. If you have not previously had your a foot or eye exam done within the past year I would have to have you get it scheduled this week in order to get it in to the system. I understand this may not be possible for you with starting a new job this week but with open enrollment starting Nov. 19th I am a bind as they will start processing the plan information after this week. Please let me know if this is something you feel like you would be able to do. If so I will need to at least speak with you today and tomorrow to start the coaching sessions.

Yes, the health risk assessment can be done online just like last year. "

t/c to member - msg left; try AGAIN to get MD records!!!
Member is a spouse of DAK Employee.   Called to report she has significantly lowered her AIC level and wanted to report this and that she had been inspired by her DDHC coach.

Hi Kim, hope you are doing well. I got my results back from the health screening a few days ago so I thought it's time to set the new goals. I am going to try to loose at least 7 to 8 pounds. I am going to watch what I eat more carefully especially with the holidays coming up. I noticed my cholesterol level was higher than it was last year. Not eating a lot of fried foods so it may be from the diet sodas I'm drinking so I'm going to cut those way down and try to find  more cholesterol friendly foods to eat. I am still doing sit ups every other day and the elliptical at least 3 to 4 times a week. I am going to cut out the beer all together, even though it's been light beer. Don't need it anyway. I'm waiting to hear back from the gynecologist on my sonohystergram. My biopsy came back with good results though. He did say though that I was completely menopausal and put me on hormone medicine which I take every morning and something else I take every night. I have a fibroid inside my uterine lining. Just waiting to hear back from the last test and see what he says my options are. I am still counting my daily calories which is helping a lot too. I will take my results with me the next time time I see my regular physician though to go over it with me. If you need any additional info for my goals please let me know. Thank you Kim

glucose 90, chol 189, HDL 26, LDL 75, Trig 614, HbgA1C 5.5, BP 138/90
Spoke with member in regards to triglyceride level 614. Member states he has never been told his chol or trig levels are high and no family hx of high levels. He also states he seen his primary MD over the summer who drew labs, he states they were all normal. Member was encouraged to see MD that this level could lead to pancreatits. He states I might make an appt. Reinforced importance of seeing MD, offered to fax results to MD. NO MD was listed on paperwork. He didnt seem inclined to offer fax # of MD.
TEP #3 Spoke with her about different types of NRT. The patch vs the gum. She doesn't feel she needs a constant flow of nicotine so I suggested speaking with her physician about  the gum option as this would just give her nicotine when needed. Has an appointment to speak with her physician tomorrow afternoon. Once she has decided a type of NRT we will move forward with a goal and plan to quite smoking. 
TEP #3
She is doing well, she is attending a grief support group to help with the loss of her brother.   She had a mammogram in August that showed something in her right breast, she will go for repeat in Jan 2014.  The most recent skin graft to her nose did not heal as expected, she had steroid injection in the scar and massages it daily several times to help it to soften and smooth out.  She is feeling well, stays up to date on her routine screenings with her MD, and feels she is taking good care of herself.  
"Called new member to review KYN results & set goals. Pleasant. 
Has not had a PE x4yr & has no PCP.
Agrees that 1st goal is to obtain a PCP by checking for MD in network, calling MD office to see if taking new pts and make an appt, then let this nurse know. 
Stated BP has been up a few other times, but it was when he broke a bone or had a car accident, so his BP would naturally be up then. BP was at 154/99 at KYN. Agrees to reduce fast food & fried foods and cut down from 5 beers/week to 2. Agrees to walking 15-20 min./day to start and then increase intensity & time. Has worked out before and lost down to 218# last yr. Is 243 now and goals to get down to 220#; to reduce BP and chol to WNL. "

Thanks for taking time to speak with me today. It was my pleasure. 
I hope our conversation & the attachments above are helpful. 

Below is a review/reminder of what we discussed for your goals and action plans. Goals are what you want to achieve. Action plans are what you plan to do to reach those goals. 
Don?t be overwhelmed by the amount of items you see below. Several are repeats. The point to take from this is that exercise and a healthy diet effects/changes everything. 

Goals 1: Find a PCP & see them
Action plans: 
?	check to see if MD is in-network with benefit plan
?	call MD office to see if they are taking new patients
?	make an appt with MD for a PE (Physical Exam) and a ?new patient appt? if necessary
?	call/email RN/health coach your MD appt date

Goal 2: Reduce BP to WNL (within normal limits, which is <120/80)
Action plans: 
?	start exercising 15-20 min/day 
?	reduce salt shaker use
?	reduce fast foods

Goal 3: Reduce cholesterol from 208 to WNL (which is <200)
Action plans: 
?	start exercising 15-20 min/day 
?	reduce fast foods
?	reduce fried foods

Goal 4: Reduce BMI by reducing weight from 243# to 220 by end of benefit plan yr
Action plans: 
?	start exercising 15-20 min/day 
?	reduce fast foods
?	reduce fried foods
?	reduce beer from 5/week to 2/week

Warm Regards,

"Hello Aileen, 

My apologies, it was my understanding last year that Dr's Health had access to our insurance claims to the degree you could see if we were compliant.
Here is a listing of the dates I believe you need in order for me to be no more than 1 issues out of compliance.

My annual well women checkup which included a pap was performed on July 23,
2013 with Dr. Rizzo, UTMB Clinic located in Webster, TX.  

I had been under the care of a PCP with visits every 6 months - Dr. Ginn, UTMB, League City, TX. - she relocated to California in September and I was fortunate to be able to locate a new PCP physician who had an opening on short notice for a new patient physical and to review the 'know your numbers' document.  This appointment was October 25, 2013  with Dr.
Strickline - UTMB Clinic, League City, TX.   

My last mammogram was October of 2012, Dr Rizzo left orders on file at the UTBM Specialty Center, League City TX and I have a schedule date for this coming November 15th. 

Please advise if you need additional information -  

Thank you,

"
"Thank you.
I will forward this to K Smothers with todays date and she will update  payroll.  
You are both now compliant for 2013
Aileen

"Assessment for DM Qualifying Exam reviewed. 
Dilated eye exam, microalbumin, foot exam and labs all completed.
Will continue to do diabetes education, as Meadow is capable of bringing her HgA1c from 7% down to 6.5%"
Reviewed DM qualifying form.  Everything completed, with excellent values achieved in all parameters. 
Member returned my call. Reviewed results of screening- bs 98, a1c 6, bp 143/78, tchol 98, hdl 52, ldl 36, tri 51.  Discussed elevated a1c- she didn't understand what diabetes is.  Explained  diabetes, and that an elevated a1c places her in a moderate risk category to develop diabetes in the future.  She has no family history of diabetes.  She does drink regular sodas on occasion.  Encouraged her to drink water, or diet soda.  Discussed diet changes to help reduce a1c, such as changing to whole grains from white bread/rice/pasta.  Encouraged regular exercise to help reduce a1c.  Her GOAL is to begin walking 3-4 times per week, 10 to 15 minutes at a time.  Encouraged her to eat fresh vegetables and plenty of fiber, decrease processed foods/fast foods.  She does not take bp medication, states she was a bit stressed at the screening, and that her bp isn't usually that high.  Encouraged her to have it rechecked, and to see her MD with her results to discuss them.
"Sorry that I was a little slow getting this to you. I had to go to a meeting.
Thanks for taking time to speak with me today ............ I KNOW you are a busy woman. SIG is blessed to have you there. 

Here is a review & reminder of what we discussed:

You have a MD appt on 11/22/2013.
?	Remember to ask him to look in your chart & tell you when you had your colonoscopy
?	You may want to also consider getting a flu vaccination if you haven?t already
?	Shoot me an email after your MD appt & let me know how it went

Goals: 
?	to reduce A1c from 5.7 to WNL (within normal limits, 5.6 or <)
?	reduce chol from 216 to WNL (<200)
?	maintain BP WNL (<120/80)

Action Plans (what to do to reach your goals): 
?	Continue to take BP & chol meds.
?	Continue to drink water and not sugared drinks
?	Greatly reduce intake of sweet foods (Sweet 16 donuts, blueberry muffins, candy, candy bars, poptarts & baking cookies). 
?	Obtain Stevia to use as a sweetener for coffee, etc. 
Exercise:
?	continue to walk daily at breaks and after work at least 15-30min/day
?	learn how to squat correctly & lunge (www.sparkpeople.com & maybe a trainer at the YMCA)

Just a couple more things I thought of?Are you taking a supplement or medication for your arthritis?
I?m taking something that I sell as a distributor & have had 3 people come off of pain meds because of it. 

ATTACHMENTS:
I?ve attached a picture of the Stevia I use. If you email it to your personal email you could have it on your phone. If you can?t do that, you can use your phone to take a picture of it. 
The Tips sheet has highlighted bullets which will effect your BS (blood sugar) the most. Try to do those first. Some you are already doing. Good job!
Glycemic Index attachment: try to avoid those fruits in the red section and limit those in the yellow. Having at least 3 whole fresh fruits/day is great for your fiber intake and are great healthy snacks.

All About Carb Counting is 2 sided sheet giving ideas of how to reduce carbs in your diet. Remember anything white turns to sugar in your blood stream (sugar, flour or anything made from them like sweet foods, breads, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.), so reduce them as much as possible. 
To answer your question, how many carbs to have in one day depends on your wt, activity level and what your body responds to. Sparkpeople can help you with deciding where to start with that. When I started on my health journey, sparkpeople is where I started, but their recommendations were a little high. So what I suggest to folks is to go by their recommendations if they are less than what you are already doing. Then reduce them until your body (or BS/A1c) responds. Since you don?t need to lose wt, you can continue to eat carbs, but make them healthy high fiber carbs (not empty calories)?like eating whole grain brown rice instead of white rice. (I was blown away when I found out that the white rice isn?t ?whole grain?!) Eat ?whole grain? bread instead of enriched/refined flour types of bread. Eat whole grain pasta (or eliminate it from your diet like I did). Most starchy veg. or food servings are only ? cup. That?s not much pasta, so I just don?t eat that anymore. 
This kind of diet change takes a mind change. I try to look at food as a source of fuel for my body and I have the option of putting toxins in it or healthy stuff. You?re worth the good healthy stuff. Avoid the mindset that ?I deserve it? after you work out. That?s kind of like saying ?I deserve to feed myself toxins after I worked a few extra calories off?. Instead think of it this way?if I eat very healthy most of the time, then I can have a tasty dessert via planning ahead and substituting, once in a while. If you eat 10 sweet things/day, if you can?t quit all together, try to cut it in half or eat smaller amounts. 
Healthy Bk ideas: is just a few suggestions regarding Bk. Remember Bananas, ? of a large one is a serving and they have a high glycemic index so alternate eating those. Eggbeaters are a great choice too. 

You may want to have one of the guys there who exercise a lot and are knowledgeable, show you how to squat. Once you get that down pat, have them show you how to lunge. Do it slow and steady at 1st so you don?t hurt yourself. Remember to never allow your knee to move forward past your toes.

Let me know if you have questions, want more info. or educational materials. 
Shoot me an update after your MD appt and again by the 10th of Dec and Jan. We will go from there.
I recommend that you work on reducing sugar in your diet for 2-3 months, then have an appt with your MD to recheck your A1c. 

It was great talking with you. 
Warm Regards,
Kim

"Sonja,

Yes, you can schedule exams and test starting September 1, 2013. However, the insurance only covers one preventative care exam per calendar year (January 1st -December 31st). If you have already completed a physical in 2013 you will need to wait until 2014 to have the insurance cover under preventative care.

Thank you"
Called to clarify email and explain that the insurance only covers one preventative care exam per calendar year (January 1st -December 31st). Since she completed her physical exam in Sep. 2013 insurance would not cover another physical exam under preventative care until 2014.

"Sonja,

Please see below. This is the information I received from Meritain.

\If she is only getting the physical exam, it looks like it?s typically around $150. Since the services will be submitted as preventive, and she has already received her preventive service for the year, I?m thinking it?s going to be denied. It wont be covered under medical because it?s preventive, and she?s already used her preventive service for the year. She could check with her doctor to see what they are going to charge, as that is what she will be responsible for.\"""
