2/19/2013  1055  Member returned my call, states she is working on her health, in particular moving toward better diabetes management.  She likes to eat carbohydrates, and she knows she must limit them, and she does, but it is a struggle. States she does eat whole grains/ brown rice whenever possible. Stated she had lost 30 pounds in the past and was trying to keep it off, but when she started on the Lantus, she regained the weight. Had been going to the YMCA three times a week until the winter but fell away from that, is actually going back today.  Plans to get back on track with exercise regimen.  Encouraged her to find an exercise buddy to help keep her on track, it is easier to be compliant when you are accountable to someone.  She agrees this is a good idea.  States she really does want to take good care of herself, it is not always easy with a busy schedule, and the foods that are readily available aren't always the best choices.  Checks her sugar about three times a week, states before lunch it was 115 recently, she was happy with that, even though it wasn't below 100.  Encouraged her to check blood sugars daily.  States her PCP is a good friend who watches her closely?  Congratulated member on her efforts?her a1c dropped from 12 in June 2012 to 8 in 11/12.  She stated this was a good thing, but she and her PCP want it closer to 7!  She stated she has already experienced some neuropathy in her feet, last year, and wants to do well at controlling her diabetes she is aware of the long term effects and doesn't want to suffer any further neuropathy or organ damage.  Encouraged member to continue in her efforts, she is worth taking care-of.  KWellsRN
