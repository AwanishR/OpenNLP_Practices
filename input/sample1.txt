Public Safety Medical recomends a Prostate exa, in 2 years
Met with -ABC- to discuss tobacco use and the long term effects of nicotine exposure.  She quit smoking in November 2011 with the help of an e-cigarette.  She was upset that she had to come to the meeting as part of her qualifying health activities. We discussed challenges that she might face and ways to work through them.  I mentioned some of the long term affects associated with long term nicotine exposure.  She feels confident that she will be nicotine free by June.  She is participating in a tough mudder competition and wants to be finished using her e-cigarette at that time.  Because she is highly motivated, she felt that she didn't need further follow ups.  She knows that she can contact the center for resources and help if she needs them.

He does understand that tobacco and nicotine use has a negative impact on his health, but overall he feels fine.  He works closely with his doctor, so he understands the risks.
